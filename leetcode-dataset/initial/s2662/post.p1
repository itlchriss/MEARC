Calculate and return the minimum cost needed to travel from the starting point `(startX, startY)` to the target point `(targetX, targetY)` using the `specialRoads` array, which is a parameter of the `minimumCost` method. The method takes two integer arrays `start` and `target` as parameters, representing the coordinates of the starting and target points respectively. The method returns an integer value representing the minimum cost required for the journey.
