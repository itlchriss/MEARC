There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given `releaseHydrogen` and `releaseOxygen` methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.
