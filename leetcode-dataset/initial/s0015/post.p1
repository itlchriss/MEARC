The algorithm takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains three integers `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]`. The algorithm ensures that the indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are distinct, and the values at these indices satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.
