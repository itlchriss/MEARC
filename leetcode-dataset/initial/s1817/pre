You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer `k`. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array `logs` where each <code>logs[i] = [ID<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the user with <code>ID<sub>i</sub></code> performed an action at the minute <code>time<sub>i</sub></code>. The **user active minutes (UAM)** for a given user is defined as the **number of unique minutes** in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.
