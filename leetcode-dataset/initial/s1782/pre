You are given an undirected graph defined by an integer `n`, the number of nodes, and a 2D integer array `edges`, the edges in the graph, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an **undirected** edge between <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer array `queries`.
