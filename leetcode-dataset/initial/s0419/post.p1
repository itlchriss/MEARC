The algorithm should be designed to count the number of battleships on the board. The board is represented by a 2D matrix of characters, with dimensions `m x n`. Each cell in the matrix can either contain a battleship, denoted by the character `'X'`, or be empty, denoted by the character `'.'`. The result of the algorithm should be an integer representing the count of battleships found on the board.
