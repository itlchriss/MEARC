The kthDistinct function takes an array of strings, arr, and an integer, k, as input. It returns the kth distinct string present in arr. If there are fewer than k distinct strings in arr, the function returns an empty string, str_. For example, if k is 2, the function will return the second distinct string in arr. However, if all strings in arr are distinct, the function will return the first string. In the given example, str_b is the only distinct string in arr. Since there are fewer than 3 distinct strings, the function will return an empty string, str_.
