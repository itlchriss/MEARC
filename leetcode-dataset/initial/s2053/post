Given an array of strings `arr`, and an integer `k`, return _the_ <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> _**distinct string** present in_ `arr`. If there are **fewer** than `k` distinct strings, return _an **empty string**_ `""`. Since k == 2, "a" is returned. All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1<sup>st</sup> string "aaa" is returned. **Explanation:** The only distinct string is "b". Since there are fewer than 3 distinct strings, we return an empty string "".
