The method countLatticePoints takes a 2D integer array called circles as input. Each element in the circles array, represented as circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri], corresponds to the center (xi, yi) and radius ri of the ith circle drawn on a grid. The method calculates and returns the number of lattice points that are present inside at least one circle.
