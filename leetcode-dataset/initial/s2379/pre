You are given a **0-indexed** string `blocks` of length `n`, where `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`, representing the color of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> block. The characters `'W'` and `'B'` denote the colors white and black, respectively. You are also given an integer `k`, which is the desired number of **consecutive** black blocks.
