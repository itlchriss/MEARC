An algorithm is implemented in a Java method that takes an integer array `nums` of length `n` as input. The integers in the `nums` array are guaranteed to be in the range `[1 ,  n]` and each integer appears either once or twice. The method returns a list of integers that appear twice in the `nums` array.
