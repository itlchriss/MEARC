Thus, we return ["word","note","wood"]. Applying any two edits to "yes" cannot make it equal to "not". Thus, we return an empty array.
Return _a list of all words from_ `queries`_,_ _that match with some word from_ `dictionary` _after a maximum of **two edits**_. Return the words in the **same order** they appear in `queries`.
