If it is not possible to make the sum of all elements in `nums1` less than or equal to `x` using the given method `minimumTime`, the method should return -1. If it is possible, the method should return the minimum time required to achieve this. The current sum of `nums1` is 4, and it has been proven that the operations used in the method are optimal. Therefore, the method should return 3 as the result.
