You are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> log message formatted as a string `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`. For example, `"0:start:3"` means a function call with function ID `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`, and `"1:end:2"` means a function call with function ID `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called **multiple times, possibly recursively**.
