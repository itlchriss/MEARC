Return _the sender with the **largest** word count_. If there is more than one sender with the largest word count, return _the one with the **lexicographically largest** name_. Since Alice has the largest word count, we return "Alice". Since there is a tie for the largest word count, we return the sender with the lexicographically larger name, Charlie.
