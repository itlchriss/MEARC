We are given `n` different types of `stickers`. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it. You would like to spell out the given string `target` by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker. **Explanation:** We cannot form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given stickers.
