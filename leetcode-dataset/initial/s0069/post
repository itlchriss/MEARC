Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return _the square root of_ `x`. Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned. **Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
