Some robots are standing on an infinite number line with their initial coordinates given by a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and will start moving once given the command to move. The robots will move a unit distance each second. You are given a string `s` denoting the direction in which robots will move on command. `'L'` means the robot will move towards the left side or negative side of the number line, whereas `'R'` means the robot will move towards the right side or positive side of the number line.
