You are given an array `points`, an integer `angle`, and your `location`, where <code>location = [pos<sub>x</sub>, pos<sub>y</sub>]</code> and <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> both denote **integral coordinates** on the X-Y plane. Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You **cannot move** from your position, but you can **rotate**. In other words, <code>pos<sub>x</sub></code> and <code>pos<sub>y</sub></code> cannot be changed. Your field of view in **degrees** is represented by `angle`, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let `d` be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the **inclusive** range of angles `[d - angle/2, d + angle/2]`.
