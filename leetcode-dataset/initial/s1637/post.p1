To find the widest vertical area between two points on a 2D plane, where each point is represented as an array of integers [xi, yi], the algorithm should be implemented as a Java method with the signature public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points). This method takes in an array of points and returns the maximum width of the vertical area such that no points lie inside it.
