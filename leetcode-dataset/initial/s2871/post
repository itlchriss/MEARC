It can be shown that we cannot split the array into more than 3 subarrays with a total score of 0. So we return 3. **Explanation:** We can split the array into one subarray: [5,7,1,3] with a score of 1, which is the minimum possible score that we can obtain. It can be shown that we cannot split the array into more than 1 subarray with a total score of 1. So we return 1.
Return _the **maximum** number of subarrays in a split that satisfies the conditions above._
