The circular deque, implemented using the Java method public MyCircularDeque(int k), showcases the utilization of its various methods. These methods are specifically designed to manipulate the deque by inserting an item at the last position, which returns a boolean value of True. Similarly, the inclusion of an item at the front position also yields a True return. However, attempting to insert an item at the front position when the deque is full results in a False return.

To retrieve the last item from the deque, the method getRear() is employed, which returns an integer value of 2. Additionally, the method isFull() can be used to check if the deque is full, returning True if it is. Deleting the last item from the deque is accomplished by using the method deleteLast(), which returns True upon successful deletion.

On the other hand, inserting an item at the front position using the method insertFront() returns True. To obtain the front item from the deque, the method getFront() is utilized, which ultimately returns the value 4. It is important to note that the circular deque supports these various methods, each serving a specific purpose.

One such method, insertFront(int value), adds an item at the front of the deque and returns the boolean value true_value if the operation is successful. Similarly, the method insertLast(int value) adds an item at the rear of the deque, also returning the true_value if successful. Furthermore, a method exists to remove an item from the front of the deque, deleteFront(), with a return value of the true_value indicating success. Likewise, the method deleteLast() deletes an item from the rear of the deque, returning the true_value if the operation is successful.

To retrieve the front item from the deque, the method getFront() is employed, returning -1 if the deque is empty. Similarly, the last item of the deque can be obtained using the method getRear(), which also returns -1 when the deque is empty. Additionally, a method is available to check if the deque is empty, isEmpty(), returning the true_value if it is.

Lastly, there exists a method to check if the deque is full, isFull(), returning the true_value if it is ultimately full.
