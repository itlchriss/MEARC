Given two integers `rMove` and `cMove` and a character `color` representing the color you are playing as (white or black), return `true` _if changing cell_ `(rMove, cMove)` _to color_ `color` _is a **legal** move, or_ `false` _if it is not legal_.
You are given a **0-indexed** `8 x 8` grid `board`, where `board[r][c]` represents the cell `(r, c)` on a game board. On the board, free cells are represented by `'.'`, white cells are represented by `'W'`, and black cells are represented by `'B'`.
