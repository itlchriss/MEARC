To find the largest subset of positive integers `nums` that satisfies the condition where every pair of elements `(answer[i], answer[j])` in this subset satisfies, we can use the Java method `public List<Integer> largestDivisibleSubset(int[] nums)`. The method takes an array of positive integers `nums` as input and returns a list `answer` as output. The `answer` list represents the largest subset that satisfies the given condition. If there are multiple solutions, any of the largest subsets can be returned.
