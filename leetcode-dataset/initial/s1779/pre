You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: `(x, y)`. You are also given an array `points` where each <code>points[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents that a point exists at <code>(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>)</code>. A point is **valid** if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.
