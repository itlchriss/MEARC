The method `sumOfNumberAndReverse` returns the true_value if the non-negative integer `num` can be expressed as the sum of any non-negative integer and its reverse. For example, when the number 172 and its reverse 271 are added, their sum is 443, indicating a true_value return. However, if the number 63 is considered, it cannot be expressed as the sum of a non-negative integer and its reverse, resulting in a false_value return. Similarly, when the number 140 and its reverse 041 are added, their sum is 181, indicating a true_value result. It is important to note that when a number is reversed, there may be leading zeros.
