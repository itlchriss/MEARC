Return _the index of the word in_ `sentence` _(**1-indexed**) where_ `searchWord` _is a prefix of this word_. If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word **(minimum index)**. If there is no such word return `-1`. **Explanation:** "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
