There is an `n x n` grid, with the top-left cell at `(0, 0)` and the bottom-right cell at `(n - 1, n - 1)`. You are given the integer `n` and an integer array `startPos` where <code>startPos = [start<sub>row</sub>, start<sub>col</sub>]</code> indicates that a robot is initially at cell <code>(start<sub>row</sub>, start<sub>col</sub>)</code>. You are also given a **0-indexed** string `s` of length `m` where `s[i]` is the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> instruction for the robot: `'L'` (move left), `'R'` (move right), `'U'` (move up), and `'D'` (move down).
