To find the value of the kth symbol in the nth row of a table with n rows, where n and k are integers, we can use the Java method public int kthGrammar(int n, int k). The method takes two parameters, n and k, and returns an integer. The value of k represents the position of the symbol in the row, and the value of n represents the row number. The method uses an algorithm to determine the value of the kth symbol in the nth row.
