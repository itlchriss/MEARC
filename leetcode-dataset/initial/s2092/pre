You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `meetings` where <code>meetings[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that person <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and person <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> have a meeting at <code>time<sub>i</sub></code>. A person may attend **multiple meetings** at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer `firstPerson`.
