The subsequence has a length of 5, so we return 5. The subsequence has a length of 4, so we return 4. **Explanation:** The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [1]. The subsequence has a length of 1, so we return 1.
Return _the length of the **longest** **subsequence** that meets the requirements._
