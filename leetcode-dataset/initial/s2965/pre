You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n initial prepare.sh run.sh n` with values in the range <code>[1, n<sup>2</sup>]</code>. Each integer appears **exactly once** except `a` which appears **twice** and `b` which is **missing**. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers `a` and `b`.
