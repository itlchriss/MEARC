Determine the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in a way that ensures there are exactly `target` neighborhoods. If it is not possible to achieve the minimum cost, return -1. This applies to the context of the Java method `minCost`, which takes parameters `houses` (an array), `cost` (a 2D array), `nColors` (an integer), and `tGroups` (an integer). The method returns an integer. The algorithm should be described using appropriate terminology.
