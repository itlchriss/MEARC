There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where <code>flights[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a flight from city <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to city <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> with cost <code>price<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return _**the cheapest price** from_ `src` _to_ `dst` _with at most_ `k` _stops._ If there is no such route, return `-1`.
