You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes, where each node is uniquely assigned a value from `1` to `n`. You are also given a sequence of `n` values `voyage`, which is the **desired** [**pre-order traversal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order) of the binary tree.
