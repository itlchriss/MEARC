For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query. For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.
Return _a **boolean array**_ `answer`_, where_ `answer.length == queries.length` _and the_ <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> _value of_ `answer` _is_ `true` _if there is a path for_ `queries[j]` _is_ `true`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.
