initial prepare.sh run.sh `int shortestPath(int node1, int node2)` returns the **minimum** cost of a path from `node1` to `node2`. If no path exists, return `-1`. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path. g.shortestPath(3, 2); // return 6. The shortest path from 3 to 2 in the first diagram above is 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 with a total cost of 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. g.shortestPath(0, 3); // return -1. There is no path from 0 to 3. g.shortestPath(0, 3); // return 6. The shortest path from 0 to 3 now is 0 -> 1 -> 3 with a total cost of 2 + 4 = 6.
