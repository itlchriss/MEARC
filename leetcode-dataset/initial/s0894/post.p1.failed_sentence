For the given Java method `public List<TreeNode> allPossibleFBT(int n)` and its helper method `public void helper(int n, List<TreeNode>[] dp)`, the algorithm returns a list of all possible full binary trees with `n` nodes. Each tree in the list has nodes where `Node.val` is equal to 0. The root node of each tree is represented as an element in the final list. The order of the trees in the final list can be arbitrary.
