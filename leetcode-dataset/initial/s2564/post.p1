The pronoun "This substring" refers to the substring in the range `[0 , 2]` in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The pronoun "Its decimal value" refers to the decimal value of the substring "101" in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The pronoun "We raise 5 to the power of 0" refers to raising the decimal value of the substring to the power of 0 in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
Hence, the answer to the first query in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)` denotes the answer for the first query.
The phrase "Moving on to the second query" refers to transitioning to the second query in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The phrase "The substring in the range `[2 , 3]`" refers to the substring in the range `[2 , 3]` in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The phrase "The decimal value of "11"" refers to the decimal value of the substring "11" in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The phrase "If we raise 3 to the power of 1" refers to raising the decimal value of the substring to the power of 1 in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The phrase "The answer for the second query" refers to the answer to the second query in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The phrase "In this particular example" refers to the specific example being discussed in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The phrase "As a result, the result is `[-1 , -1]`" refers to the return value of the function when there is no substring that satisfies the query condition in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
The array `ans` in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)` contains the answers for each query, in summary.
Each answer in the array `ans` is represented as `[left_i , right_i]`, which refers to the representation of each answer using the indices of the substring that fulfills the query condition in the given Java method `substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries)`.
