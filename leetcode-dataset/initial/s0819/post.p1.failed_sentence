The method `mostCommonWord` takes in a string `paragraph` and a string array `banned` as parameters. It guarantees that there is at least one word in `paragraph` that is not in the `banned` array, and the result will be a unique word. The words in `paragraph` are not case-sensitive, and the returned word should be in lowercase. The algorithm should find the word that appears most frequently in `paragraph` and is not in the `banned` array.
