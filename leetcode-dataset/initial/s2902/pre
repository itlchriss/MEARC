You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of non-negative integers, and two integers `l` and `r`. A **sub-multiset** is an **unordered** collection of elements of the array in which a given value `x` can occur `0, 1, ..., occ[x]` times, where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the array.
