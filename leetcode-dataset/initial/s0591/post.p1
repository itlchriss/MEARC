When a string representing a code snippet is passed as a parameter to the isValid method, a tag validator algorithm is executed to analyze the code and determine its validity. The code is considered valid if and only if the TAG_CONTENT, which refers to the content within the tags, is valid. In such cases, the algorithm returns the true_value, indicating that the code snippet is valid.
