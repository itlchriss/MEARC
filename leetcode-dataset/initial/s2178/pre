You are given an integer `finalSum`. Split it into a sum of a **maximum** number of **unique** positive even integers. initial prepare.sh run.sh For example, given `finalSum = 12`, the following splits are **valid** (unique positive even integers summing up to `finalSum`): `(12)`, `(2 + 10)`, `(2 + 4 + 6)`, and `(4 + 8)`. Among them, `(2 + 4 + 6)` contains the maximum number of integers. Note that `finalSum` cannot be split into `(2 + 2 + 4 + 4)` as all the numbers should be unique. **Explanation:** There are no valid splits for the given finalSum. Thus, we return an empty array.
