The `getRandom()` method returns a random element from the current set of elements. This method ensures that at least one element exists when called because each element in the set has an equal probability of being returned.

The `insert(int val)` method inserts an item `val` into the set if it is not already present. The method returns `true` if the item is successfully inserted and `false` if it is not.

The `remove(int val)` method removes an item `val` from the set if it is present. The method returns `true` if the item is successfully removed and `false` if it is not.

An example usage of these methods is as follows
