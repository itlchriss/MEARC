You are given an array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of new customers arriving just before the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> rotation (0-indexed). This means you **must rotate the wheel** `i` **times before the** `customers[i]` **customers arrive**. **You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola**. Each customer pays `boardingCost` dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.
