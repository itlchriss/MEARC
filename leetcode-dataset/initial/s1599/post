Return _the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit._ If there is **no scenario** where the profit is positive, return `-1`. **Explanation:** 1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 3 \* $1 - 1 \* $92 = -$89. 2. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 \* $1 - 2 \* $92 = -$177. 3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 \* $1 - 3 \* $92 = -$269. 4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 \* $1 - 4 \* $92 = -$357. 5. 1 customer arrives, 2 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 13 \* $1 - 5 \* $92 = -$447. The profit was never positive, so return -1.
