To find the highest altitude of a point, you need to pass an integer array `gain` of length `n` to the method `largestAltitude`. Each element `gain[i]` in the array represents the net gain in altitude between points `i` and `i + 1`, where `0 <= i < n`. The method should return the maximum altitude achieved by applying the algorithm described.
