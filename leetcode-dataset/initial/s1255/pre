Given a list of `words`, list of single `letters` (might be repeating) and `score` of every character. Given letters, we can form the words "dad" (5+1+5) and "good" (3+2+2+5) with a score of 23. Given letters, we can form the words "ax" (4+5), "bx" (4+5) and "cx" (4+5) with a score of 27.
Return the maximum score of **any** valid set of words formed by using the given letters (`words[i]` cannot be used two or more times). It is not necessary to use all characters in `letters` and each letter can only be used once. Score of letters `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, ... ,`'z'` is given by `score[0]`, `score[1]`, ... , `score[25]` respectively.
