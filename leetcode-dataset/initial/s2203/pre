You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a **weighted directed** graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists a **directed** edge from <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>. Lastly, you are given three **distinct** integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.
