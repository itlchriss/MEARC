Given a Java method `public List<Integer> countSmaller(int[] nums)`, the method takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns a new integer array `counts`. The `counts` array has the property where each element `counts[i]` represents the number of smaller elements to the right of `nums[i]`. To achieve this, the method utilizes a Fenwick Tree data structure, which is initialized using the length of the `nums` array (`n`). The method also includes an `update` function that takes an index `i` and a value `v` to update the Fenwick Tree. The algorithm implemented in the method calculates the number of smaller elements to the right of each element in `nums` by iterating through the array and updating the Fenwick Tree accordingly.
