Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, return _the **minimum integer common** to both arrays_. If there is no common integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`. **Explanation:** The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2. **Explanation:** There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.
