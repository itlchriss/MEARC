Given an integer array `nums` containing **distinct** **positive** integers, find and return **any** number from the array that is neither the **minimum** nor the **maximum** value in the array, or **`-1`** if there is no such number.
**Explanation:** Since there is no number in nums that is neither the maximum nor the minimum, we cannot select a number that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, there is no answer.
