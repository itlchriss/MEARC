Given a string `input` representing the file system in the explained format, return _the length of the **longest absolute path** to a **file** in the abstracted file system_. If there is no file in the system, return `0`. **Explanation:** We have two files: "dir/subdir1/file1.ext" of length 21 "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext" of length 32. We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.
