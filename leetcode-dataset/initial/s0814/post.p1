To solve the problem, we need to implement an algorithm that takes a binary tree represented by the `root` node and returns a modified version of the same tree. In the modified tree, any subtree that does not contain a node with the value `1` should be removed. The algorithm should not modify the original tree and should return a new tree with the desired changes.
