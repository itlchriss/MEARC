The maximumGood method in Java returns the highest count of individuals who can be deemed as good based on the statements they have made. In the best case scenario, if we observe that a maximum of 2 individuals are considered good, the method will return the value 2. Similarly, if we observe that only one person is considered good, the method will return the value 1. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the highest count of individuals who can be deemed as good solely based on the statements they have made.
