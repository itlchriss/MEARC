You are given an integer `n` and an integer `p` in the range `[0, n - 1]`. Representing a **0-indexed** array `arr` of length `n` where all positions are set to `0`'s, except position `p` which is set to `1`. You are also given an integer array `banned` containing some positions from the array. For the **i**<sup>**th**</sup> position in `banned`, `arr[banned[i]] = 0`, and `banned[i] != p`.
