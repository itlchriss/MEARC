**Explanation:** The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned. **Explanation:** The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
Return _the length of the **longest path** in the tree such that no pair of **adjacent** nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them._
