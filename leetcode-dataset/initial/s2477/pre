There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) structure country network consisting of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` roads. The capital city is city `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `roads` where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists a **bidirectional road** connecting cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. There is a car in each city. You are given an integer `seats` that indicates the number of seats in each car.
