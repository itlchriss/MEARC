Given an integer array `nums`, return _the **third distinct maximum** number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the **maximum** number_. **Explanation:** The first distinct maximum is 2. The second distinct maximum is 1. The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
