The algorithm takes an integer array `nums`, and two integers `k` and `t` as input. It checks if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is less than or equal to `t`, and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k`. If such indices exist, the algorithm returns `true`.
