2359\. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes
You are given a **directed** graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **at most one** outgoing edge. The graph is represented with a given **0-indexed** array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`. You are also given two integers `node1` and `node2`.
