initial prepare.sh run.sh For example, when the system is queried for the <code>4<sup>th</sup></code> time, it returns the <code>4<sup>th</sup></code> best location of all locations already added. initial prepare.sh run.sh `string get()` Queries and returns the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> best location, where `i` is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation). // This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time get() is called, so return the best location: "branford".
// Return the 2<sup>nd</sup> best location "alps", as it is the 2<sup>nd</sup> time get() is called. // Return "bradford", as it is the 3<sup>rd</sup> time get() is called. // Return "bradford". // Return "bradford". // Return "orland".
