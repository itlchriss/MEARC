The `pop()` function in the `FreqStack` class removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack. If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element that is closest to the top of the stack will be removed and returned. When we execute the `pop()` function, the result is the most frequent element in the stack. After this operation, the stack is updated with the remaining elements. If we call the `pop()` function again, the result is the next most frequent element, considering the tie-breaker rule. Similarly, each subsequent call to the `pop()` function returns the next most frequent element until the stack is empty. Finally, when we execute the `pop()` function on an empty stack, it returns -1.
