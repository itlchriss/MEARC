You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `roads` where <code>roads[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that there is a road between intersections <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> that takes <code>time<sub>i</sub></code> minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` in the **shortest amount of time**.
