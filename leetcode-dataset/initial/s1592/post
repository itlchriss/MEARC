Rearrange the spaces so that there is an **equal** number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is **maximized**. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the **extra spaces at the end**, meaning the returned string should be the same length as `text`.
Return _the string after rearranging the spaces_.
