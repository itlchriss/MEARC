There is an **undirected** graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and a **2D** array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. The graph can be disconnected.
