You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a **perfect binary tree** consisting of nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. The root of the tree is node `1` and each node `i` in the tree has two children where the left child is the node `2 initial prepare.sh run.sh i` and the right child is `2 initial prepare.sh run.sh i + 1`. Each node in the tree also has a **cost** represented by a given **0-indexed** integer array `cost` of size `n` where `cost[i]` is the cost of node `i + 1`. You are allowed to **increment** the cost of **any** node by `1` **any** number of times.
