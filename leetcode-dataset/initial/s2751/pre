You are given **0-indexed** integer arrays `positions`, `healths`, and a string `directions` (`directions[i]` is either **'L'** for **left** or **'R'** for **right**). All integers in `positions` are **unique**. All robots start moving on the line **simultaneously** at the **same speed** in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will **collide**. Your task is to determine the **health** of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same **order** that the robots were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array. Return _an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur._
