If the length of the longest contiguous segment of 1's in the binary string `s` is greater than the length of the longest contiguous segment of 0's in `s`, then return the value `true`. Otherwise, if the length of the segment of 1's is not greater than the length of the segment of 0's, then return the value `false`. Since the length of the segment of 1's is longer, the statement evaluates to `true`.
