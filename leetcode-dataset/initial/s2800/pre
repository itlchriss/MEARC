Given three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, your task is to find a string that has the **minimum** length and contains all three strings as **substrings**.
**Explanation:** We show that "aaabca" contains all the given strings: a = ans[2...4], b = ans[3..5], c = ans[0..2]. It can be shown that the length of the resulting string would be at least 6 and "aaabca" is the lexicographically smallest one. **Explanation:** We show that the string "aba" contains all the given strings: a = ans[0..1], b = ans[1..2], c = ans[0..2]. Since the length of c is 3, the length of the resulting string would be at least 3. It can be shown that "aba" is the lexicographically smallest one.
