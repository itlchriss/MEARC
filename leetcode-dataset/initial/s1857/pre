You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English letter representing the **color** of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node in this graph (**0-indexed**). You are also given a 2D array `edges` where <code>edges[j] = [a<sub>j</sub>, b<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a **directed edge** from node <code>a<sub>j</sub></code> to node <code>b<sub>j</sub></code>. Return _the **largest color value** of any valid path in the given graph, or_ `-1` _if the graph contains a cycle_.
