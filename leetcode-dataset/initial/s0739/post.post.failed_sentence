Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return _an array_ `answer` _such that_ `answer[i]` _is the number of days you have to wait after the_ <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> _day to get a warmer temperature_. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.
