The method `maxDistance` takes a square grid of size `n x n` as input, where each cell in the grid contains either a `0` representing water or a `1` representing land. The goal of the method is to find the water cell that is farthest from any land cell and return the distance to that cell. If the grid does not contain any land or water, the method should return `-1`.
