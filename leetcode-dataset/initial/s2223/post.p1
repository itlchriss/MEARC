When the final string `s` is provided as input to the `sumScores` method, the algorithm calculates the sum of the scores for each `si` in `s`. The scores are then added together to obtain the final result. For example, if `s` is "10305", the scores would be 1, 0, 3, 0, and 5, resulting in a sum of 9. Similarly, if `s` is "239", the scores would be 2, 3, and 9, resulting in a sum of 14.
