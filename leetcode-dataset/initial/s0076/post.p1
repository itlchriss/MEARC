The function `minWindow` takes two strings `s` and `t` as input, where `s` has a length of `m` and `t` has a length of `n`. It returns the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters in `t`, including duplicates. If there is no such substring, the function returns an empty string `str_`. In this case, both occurrences of the character 'a' in `t` must be present in the window. To clarify, if the largest window in `s` only contains one 'a', the function will return an empty string.
