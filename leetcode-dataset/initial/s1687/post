initial prepare.sh run.sh The ship then makes a return **trip** to storage to take more boxes from the queue. - The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips. **Explanation:** The optimal strategy is as follows: - The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips. - The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips. - The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips. So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. - The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips. - The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips. - The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
Return _the **minimum** number of **trips** the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports._
