Determine whether the largest element in the array is **at least twice** as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return _the **index** of the largest element, or return_ `-1` _otherwise_. **Explanation:** 6 is the largest integer. For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x. The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1. **Explanation:** 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.
