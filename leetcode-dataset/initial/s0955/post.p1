If we choose a set of deletion indices `answer` for the given Java method `public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs)`, the resulting array will have the elements of `strs` arranged in lexicographic order. This means that each element `strs[i]` will be less than or equal to `strs[i+1]`, for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `strs`. In this case, the function should return the minimum possible length of `answer`, which represents the number of deletions needed to achieve the desired lexicographic order.
