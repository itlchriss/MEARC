For the given Java method (public int[][] matrixRankTransform(int[][] matrix)), the algorithm should take a matrix of size `m x n` as input and generate a new matrix called str_answer. Each element "str_answer[row][col]" in the new matrix should represent the rank of the corresponding element "matrix[row][col]".
