The function `sum` in the Java method `public int sum(int num1, int num2)` returns the sum of the two integers `num1` and `num2`. To explain this concept, let's consider the values of `num1` and `num2`. For example, if `num1` is 12 and `num2` is 5, their sum would be calculated as 12 + 5 = 17. Therefore, the function would return 17. Similarly, if the sum of `num1` and `num2` is -6, the function would also return -6. This algorithm ensures that the pronouns are resolved and the sentence applies specifically to the given Java method, without mentioning it explicitly.
