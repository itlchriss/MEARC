The task of the `digArtifacts` method is to determine the number of artifacts that can be extracted from a 0-indexed 2D integer array `dig`. This array represents a grid where each element `dig[i] = [ri, ci]` indicates that the cell at coordinates `(ri, ci)` will be excavated. The artifacts in the grid are represented by different colors.

To solve this task, we need to count the number of artifacts that have all their parts uncovered, which are indicated by a 'D' in the grid. For example, if there is a single extractable artifact, specifically the red artifact, the method should return 1. On the other hand, if there is a blue artifact that has one part in cell (1, 1) remaining uncovered, the method should not count it as extractable.

In the given method, the parameter `n` represents the size of the grid, `artifacts` is a 2D array that contains the coordinates of the artifacts, and `dig` is the 2D array representing the grid. The method should return an integer value representing the count of extractable artifacts.

Both the red and blue artifacts have all their parts uncovered (labeled with a 'D') and can be extracted in the same way. Therefore, the method should return a value of 2 in this case.
