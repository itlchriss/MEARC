Given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `dig` where <code>dig[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you will excavate the cell <code>(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code>, return _the number of artifacts that you can extract_. **Explanation:** The different colors represent different artifacts. Excavated cells are labeled with a 'D' in the grid. There is 1 artifact that can be extracted, namely the red artifact. The blue artifact has one part in cell (1,1) which remains uncovered, so we cannot extract it. Thus, we return 1. **Explanation:** Both the red and blue artifacts have all parts uncovered (labeled with a 'D') and can be extracted, so we return 2.
