The Java method `tictactoe` takes a 2D integer array `moves` as input, where each element `moves[i]` represents a move to be played on the `grid[row_i][col_i]`. The method determines the winner (A or B) if there is one, and returns their name. If the game ends in a draw, the method returns "str_Draw". If there are still moves to be played, the method returns "str_Pending".
