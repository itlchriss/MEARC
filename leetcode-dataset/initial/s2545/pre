There is a class with `m` students and `n` exams. You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `score`, where each row represents one student and `score[i][j]` denotes the score the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student got in the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> exam. The matrix `score` contains **distinct** integers only. You are also given an integer `k`. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> (**0-indexed**) exam from the highest to the lowest.
