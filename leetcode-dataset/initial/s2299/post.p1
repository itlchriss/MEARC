The Java method `strongPasswordCheckerII` takes a string parameter `password` and returns a boolean value. If the `password` meets all the requirements of a strong password, the method should return `true`. In any other case, it should return `false`. 

If the `password` fulfills all the requirements, the method will return `true`. However, if the `password` lacks a digit and contains two identical characters in adjacent positions, the method will return `false`. Additionally, if the `password` does not meet the required length, the method will also return `false`.
