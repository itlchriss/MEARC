 the value must have been previously set with a `timestamp_prev` that is less than or equal to the given `timestamp`. If there are multiple values that meet this condition, the result is the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values that meet the condition, the result is an empty string `str_`. For example, when calling the `get` function with parameters `key="foo"` and `timestamp=1`, it will return the value "bar". Similarly, when calling the `get` function with parameters `key=str_foo` and `timestamp=3`, it will return the value "bar" since there is no value associated with "foo" at timestamp 3. When calling the `get` function with parameters `key=str_foo` and `timestamp=4`, it will return the value "bar2" in a similar manner. Additionally, when calling the `get` function with parameters `key=str_foo` and `timestamp=5`, it will also return the value "bar2".
