Create a method that takes in a 2D integer array called 'queries' as a parameter. The method should return an integer array called 'answer' where the length of 'answer' is equal to the length of 'queries'. Each element 'answer[i]' in the 'answer' array should represent the answer to the i-th query in the 'queries' array.
