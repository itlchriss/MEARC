You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, of equal length `n`. Find the **minimum** total cost of performing the given operation **any** number of times such that `nums1[i] != nums2[i]` for all `0 <= i <= n - 1` after performing all the operations. **Explanation:** It can be shown that it is not possible to satisfy the given conditions irrespective of the number of operations we perform. Hence, we return -1.
