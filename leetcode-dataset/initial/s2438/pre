Given a positive integer `n`, there exists a **0-indexed** array called `powers`, composed of the **minimum** number of powers of `2` that sum to `n`. The array is sorted in **non-decreasing** order, and there is **only one** way to form the array.
You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries`, where <code>queries[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code>. Each `queries[i]` represents a query where you have to find the product of all `powers[j]` with <code>left<sub>i</sub> <= j <= right<sub>i</sub></code>.
