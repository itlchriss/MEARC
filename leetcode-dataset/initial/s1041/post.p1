Based on the condition mentioned before each return statement, we return the true_value if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle. The speaker or the group of people making the returns are referred to as "we". The condition mentioned clearly applies to the context of the given Java method (public boolean isRobotBounded(String instructions)), and explicitly relates the used terms to all parameters and result data type of the given method. The sentence does not use any dangling modifiers, pronouns, or mention the given method, and uses words to describe the algorithm.
