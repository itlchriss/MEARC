Reconstruct the queue represented by the input array `people` and return it. The returned queue should be formatted as the array `queue`. Each element `queue[j]` in this array should represent the attributes of the jth person in the queue. `Queue[j]` should be equal to `[hj, kj]`, where `hj` represents the height and `kj` represents the number of people in front of the jth person. The reconstructed queue, referred to as "it", should have the person at the front of the queue corresponding to `queue[0]`. This ensures that the terms used in the context of the given Java method `public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people)` are clearly applied and related to all parameters and the result data type of the method. The algorithm should be described using words, avoiding dangling modifiers, pronouns, and explicit mention of the given method.
