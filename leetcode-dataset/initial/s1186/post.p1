To find the maximum sum of a non-empty subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion in the given Java method (public int maximumSum(int[] arr)), you need to provide an array of integers as input. The algorithm will select a subarray and give you the option to remove one element from it. This ensures that at least one element remains in the subarray while maximizing the sum of the remaining elements. The method will return an integer representing the maximum sum.
