You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in an **undirected** graph. The nodes are labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i,</sub> b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a **bidirectional** edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. **Notice** that the given graph may be disconnected. Return _the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum_ `m`_) into which you can divide the nodes_. Return `-1` _if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions_.
