You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads` where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, distance<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> with a distance equal to <code>distance<sub>i</sub></code>. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.
