There is a robot starting at the position `(0, 0)`, the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot **ends up at** `(0, 0)` after it completes its moves.
You are given a string `moves` that represents the move sequence of the robot where `moves[i]` represents its <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> move. Valid moves are `'R'` (right), `'L'` (left), `'U'` (up), and `'D'` (down).
