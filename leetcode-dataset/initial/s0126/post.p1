If there are no shortest transformation sequences from the `beginWord` to the `endWord` in the given list of words, the Java method should return an empty list. The method should return each sequence as a list of words, starting with the `beginWord` and followed by a series of intermediate words (`s1`, `s2`, ..., `sk`), until the `endWord` is reached. The method should use words to describe the algorithm and clearly relate the terms used to the `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList` parameters, as well as the result data type of the method, which is a list of lists of strings.
