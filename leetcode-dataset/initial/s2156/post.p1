The algorithm provided outlines the process of calculating the hash value for a substring and identifying the first substring of length k that matches a given hash value. The algorithm takes into account the parameters of the Java method, including the input string (s), the power, modulo, and length (k) values, and the desired hash value. The result of the algorithm is a substring that satisfies the specified conditions.
