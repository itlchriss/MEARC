 Starting from the head of `headA`, the values in the list are [2, 6, 4]. Starting from the head of `headB`, the values in the list are [1, 5]. If the two lists do not intersect, the value of `intersectVal` must be 0, while `skipA` and `skipB` can be any arbitrary values.

Since the two lists do not intersect, the function will return the `null` value.
