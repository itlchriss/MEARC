To efficiently find the first bad version in the given Java method, we need to implement a function that minimizes the number of calls to the API. This function should take an integer parameter, `version`, and return a boolean value indicating whether the `version` is bad. By carefully designing the algorithm, we can ensure that the function accurately identifies the first bad version without any ambiguity.
