Given a string `formula` representing a chemical formula, return _the count of each atom_.
Return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than `1`), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than `1`), and so on.
