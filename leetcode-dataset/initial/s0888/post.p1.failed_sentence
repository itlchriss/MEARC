The fairCandySwap method takes two integer arrays, `aliceSizes` and `bobSizes`, as input parameters. It returns an integer array `answer` where `answer[0]` represents the number of candies that Alice must exchange, and `answer[1]` represents the number of candies that Bob must exchange. The method guarantees that there is at least one valid answer. If there are multiple valid answers, the method can return any one of them.
