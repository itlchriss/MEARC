There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where <code>prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you **must** take course <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> first if you want to take course <code>a<sub>i</sub></code>.
