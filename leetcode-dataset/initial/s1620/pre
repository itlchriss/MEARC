You are given an array of network towers `towers`, where <code>towers[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, q<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> network tower with location <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> and quality factor <code>q<sub>i</sub></code>. All the coordinates are **integral coordinates** on the X-Y plane, and the distance between the two coordinates is the **Euclidean distance**. You are also given an integer `radius` where a tower is **reachable** if the distance is **less than or equal to** `radius`. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is **not reachable**.
