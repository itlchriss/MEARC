The `addCar` function in the `parkingSystem` class checks if there is an accessible parking space for a car to enter, based on the specified `carType`. The `carType` can be 1 (representing a big car), 2 (representing a medium car), or 3 (representing a small car). A car can only park in a space that matches its `carType`. If there is no available space, the function returns the false_value. However, if there is an appropriate size space, the car is parked and the function returns the true_value. For example, when `parkingSystem.addCar(1)` is called, it returns the true_value, indicating the presence of an available slot for a big car. Similarly, `parkingSystem.addCar(2)` returns the true_value, indicating the presence of an available slot for a medium car. On the other hand, `parkingSystem.addCar(3)` returns the false_value, indicating the absence of an available slot for a small car. Lastly, `parkingSystem.addCar(1)` returns the false_value, indicating the absence of an available slot for a big car as it is already occupied.
