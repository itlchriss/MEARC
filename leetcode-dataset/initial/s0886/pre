Given the integer `n` and the array `dislikes` where <code>dislikes[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the person labeled <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> does not like the person labeled <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>, return `true` _if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way_.
