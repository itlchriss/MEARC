Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` _if you can visit **all** the rooms, or_ `false` _otherwise_. **Explanation:** We visit room 0 and pick up key 1. We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2. We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3. We then visit room 3. Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
