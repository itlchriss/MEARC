The method `getTweetCountsPerFrequency` is called with the parameters `freq`, `tweetName`, `startTime`, and `endTime`. As a result, a list of integers is returned that represents the count of tweets with the specified tweet name in each time chunk for the given period of time. The time chunks are determined based on the frequency and the start and end times provided.
