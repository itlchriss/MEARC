To ensure that the remaining intervals in the `intervals` array do not overlap, determine the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed. This can be achieved by implementing an algorithm that analyzes the intervals and calculates the optimal solution. The result of this algorithm should be an integer value representing the minimum number of intervals to remove.
