When a binary tree's `root` is provided as a parameter to the method, the algorithm can be used to return a list of lists containing the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. This traversal alternates the direction from left to right and right to left for each level of the tree. The result data type of the method is a `List<List<Integer>>`.
