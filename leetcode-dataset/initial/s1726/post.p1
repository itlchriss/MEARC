The Java method `tupleSameProduct` takes an array `nums` of positive integers with distinct values as input. The method's task is to find the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` in `nums` such that the product of `a` and `b` is equal to the product of `c` and `d`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct elements of `nums`. The method returns an integer representing the count of such tuples.
