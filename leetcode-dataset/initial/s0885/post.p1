By implementing the spiralMatrixIII algorithm in Java, we can ensure that each position in the grid, represented by the parameters rows and cols, will be visited in a clockwise spiral shape. If the movement goes beyond the grid's boundary, it should continue outside the grid and potentially return to the grid boundary later. Eventually, all spaces of the grid's rows, initial, prepare.sh, run.sh, and cols will be reached. The result of this algorithm will be an array of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.
