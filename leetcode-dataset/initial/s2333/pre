You are given two positive **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`. You are also given two positive integers `k1` and `k2`. You can modify any of the elements of `nums1` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k1` times. Similarly, you can modify any of the elements of `nums2` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k2` times.
