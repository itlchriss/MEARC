The Java method `longestWord` takes an array of strings called `words` as input. It returns the longest word in the array that can be constructed by combining other words in the array, one character at a time. If there are multiple possible answers, the method returns the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no such word, the method returns an empty string.
