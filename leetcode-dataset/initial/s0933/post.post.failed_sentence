initial prepare.sh run.sh `int ping(int t)` Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that has happened in the past `3000` milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range `[t - 3000, t]`. **Explanation:** RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter(); recentCounter.ping(1); // requests = [1], range is [-2999,1], return 1 recentCounter.ping(100); // requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900,100], return 2 recentCounter.ping(3001); // requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1,3001], return 3 recentCounter.ping(3002); // requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2,3002], return 3
