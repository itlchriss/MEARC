It can be shown that we need to remove at least 2 obstacles, so we return 2. **Explanation:** We can move from (0, 0) to (2, 4) without removing any obstacles, so we return 0.
Return _the **minimum** number of **obstacles** to **remove** so you can move from the upper left corner_ `(0, 0)` _to the lower right corner_ `(m - 1, n - 1)`.
