Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns **the span** of that stock's price for the current day. stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1 stockSpanner.next(80); // return 1 stockSpanner.next(60); // return 1 stockSpanner.next(70); // return 2 stockSpanner.next(60); // return 1 stockSpanner.next(75); // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price. stockSpanner.next(85); // return 6
initial prepare.sh run.sh `int next(int price)` Returns the **span** of the stock's price given that today's price is `price`.
