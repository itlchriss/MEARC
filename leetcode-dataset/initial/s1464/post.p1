To find the maximum product of two distinct elements in the integer array `nums`, we will select two different indices `i` and `j`. The product will be calculated by subtracting 1 from each element `(nums[i]-1)` and `(nums[j]-1)`. Finally, we will return the maximum value obtained from this calculation.
