There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges in the graph are represented by a given 2D integer array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes an edge between vertex <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and vertex <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.
