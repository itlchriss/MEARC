You are given `n` cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different). You can flip any number of cards (possibly zero). You are given two integer array `fronts` and `backs` where `fronts[i]` and `backs[i]` are the integers printer on the front and the back of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> card respectively.
