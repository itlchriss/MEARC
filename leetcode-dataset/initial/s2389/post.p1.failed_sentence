The algorithm should return an array `answer` of length `m`, where each element `answer[i]` represents the maximum size of a subsequence that can be obtained from the input array `nums`. This subsequence should have a sum of its elements that is less than or equal to the corresponding element `queries[i]` in the input array `queries`.
