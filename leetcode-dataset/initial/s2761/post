Return _the 2D sorted list of prime number pairs_ <code>[x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>. The list should be sorted in **increasing** order of <code>x<sub>i</sub></code>. If there are no prime number pairs at all, return _an empty array_. These pairs are [3,7] and [5,5], and we return them in the sorted order as described in the problem statement. We can show that there is no prime number pair that gives a sum of 2, so we return an empty array.
