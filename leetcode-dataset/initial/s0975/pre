You are given an integer array `arr`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, ...) jumps in the series are called **odd-numbered jumps**, and the (2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, ...) jumps in the series are called **even-numbered jumps**. Note that the **jumps** are numbered, not the indices.
