You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where <code>trips[i] = [numPassengers<sub>i</sub>, from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> trip has <code>numPassengers<sub>i</sub></code> passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location. Return `true` _if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or_ `false` _otherwise_.
