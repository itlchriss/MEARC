To find the length of the longest common subsequence between two given strings, `text1` and `text2`, an algorithm is implemented. The algorithm takes two string parameters, `text1` and `text2`, and returns an integer value representing the length of the longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence between the two strings, the algorithm returns 0.
