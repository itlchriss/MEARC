In the Java method `findPeakElement`, which takes an integer array `nums` as input, the goal is to find a peak element and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, the method can return the index to any of the peaks. For example, if the peak element is 3, the method should return the index number 2. Similarly, the method can return either index number 1 or index number 5, where the peak elements are 2 and 6 respectively.
