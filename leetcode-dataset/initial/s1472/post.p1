The `back` function in the `BrowserHistory` class allows the user to navigate back in the browsing history by a specified number of steps. The parameter `steps` determines how many steps the user wants to go back. However, if the number of steps exceeds the available history, the function will only go back the maximum number of steps possible. The result of moving back in history is the current URL up to `steps` times.

Similarly, the `forward` function in the `BrowserHistory` class allows the user to navigate forward in the browsing history by a specified number of steps. The parameter `steps` determines how many steps the user wants to go forward. As long as the number of steps does not exceed the available history, the function will move forward the maximum number of steps possible. The result of moving forward in history is the current URL up to `steps` times.
