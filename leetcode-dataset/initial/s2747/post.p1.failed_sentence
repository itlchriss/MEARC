The algorithm should return an integer array, named "arr", with a length equal to the length of the "qs" array. Each element "arr[i]" in the array represents the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the time interval [qs[i] x, qs[i]]. The "n" parameter represents the total number of servers, the "logs" parameter is a 2D array containing the timestamps of server requests, and the "x" parameter represents the time interval.
