A **cornered path** is defined as a set of adjacent cells with **at most** one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either **horizontally** or **vertically** up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the **alternate** direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell. The grid on the right is not a cornered path as it requires a return to a previously visited cell.
Return _the **maximum** number of **trailing zeros** in the product of a cornered path found in_ `grid`.
