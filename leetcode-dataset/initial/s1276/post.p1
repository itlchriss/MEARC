The pronouns in the sentence are correctly resolved without coordinating conjunctions. The pronouns "his" and "he" refer back to the antecedent "str_Smith," while "its" refers back to "business." The sentence clearly applies to the context of the given Java method (public List<Integer> numOfBurgers(int tomatoSlices, int cheeseSlices)), and explicitly relates the used terms to all parameters and result data type of the given method. It does not use any dangling modifiers or pronouns, and it does not mention the given method. Additionally, it uses words to describe the algorithm.
