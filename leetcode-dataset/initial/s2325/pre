You are given the strings `key` and `message`, which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. The steps to decode `message` are as follows: initial prepare.sh run.sh For example, given <code>key = "<ins>**hap**</ins>p<ins>**y**</ins> <ins>**bo**</ins>y"</code> (actual key would have **at least one** instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial substitution table of (`'h' -> 'a'`, `'a' -> 'b'`, `'p' -> 'c'`, `'y' -> 'd'`, `'b' -> 'e'`, `'o' -> 'f'`).
