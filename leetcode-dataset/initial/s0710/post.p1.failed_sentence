To ensure that the `pick()` function in the Java method `public Solution(int n, int[] blacklist) public int pick()` selects an integer within the range of `[0 ,  n 1]` that is not present in the `blacklist` array, an algorithm is required. This algorithm should randomly choose an integer from the range, with each integer having an equal probability of being returned.
