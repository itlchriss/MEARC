There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the **value** of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges`, where each <code>edges[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>, time<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>j</sub></code>, and it takes <code>time<sub>j</sub></code> seconds to travel between the two nodes. Finally, you are given an integer `maxTime`.
