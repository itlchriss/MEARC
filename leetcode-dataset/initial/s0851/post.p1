The algorithm should return an integer array `answer` that satisfies the condition `answer[x] = y`. Here, `y` represents the person with the least quietness among all individuals who have an equal or greater amount of money than person `x`. The quietness of a person is determined by the smallest value of `quiet[y]`. The method takes in parameters `richer`, which is a 2D array representing the richer relationships between individuals, and `quiet`, which is an array representing the quietness levels of each person. The method returns the `answer` array.
