The `hasFrequency` method in the `FrequencyTracker` class is a boolean function that checks if there is a number in the data structure that occurs a specific number of times. It takes an integer parameter called `frequency` which represents the desired number of occurrences. 

If there is a number in the data structure that occurs `frequency` number of times, the method will return `true`. For example, if we call `frequencyTracker.hasFrequency(2)`, it will return `true` if the number 3 occurs twice in the data structure.

On the other hand, if the data structure is empty or there is no number that occurs `frequency` number of times, the method will return `false`. For instance, calling `frequencyTracker.hasFrequency(1)` will return `false` if the data structure is empty.

It is important to note that the method does not modify the data structure itself. It only checks the frequency of numbers in the structure.
