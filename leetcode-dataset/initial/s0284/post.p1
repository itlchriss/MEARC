The `next()` function of the `PeekingIterator` class returns the next element in the array `[1, 2, 3]` and advances the pointer to the following element. Meanwhile, the `peek()` function of the `PeekingIterator` class returns the next element in the array `[1, 2, 3]` without advancing the pointer.

Afterwards, the `next()` function of the `PeekingIterator` class returns 2 and moves the pointer to the next element in the array `[1, 2, 3]`. 

Subsequently, the `next()` function of the `PeekingIterator` class returns 3 and advances the pointer to the next element in the array `[1, 2, 3]`.

Finally, the `hasNext()` function of the `PeekingIterator` class returns `False`, indicating that there are no more elements in the array.

The `next()` function of the `PeekingIterator` class, defined in the `public PeekingIterator(Iterator<Integer> iterator)` method, retrieves the next element in the array and advances the pointer to the following element. In contrast, the `hasNext()` function of the `PeekingIterator` class, defined in the `public PeekingIterator(Iterator<Integer> iterator)` method, returns `true` as long as there are still elements in the array.

Additionally, the `peek()` function of the `PeekingIterator` class, defined in the `public Integer peek()` method, returns the next element in the array without advancing the pointer.
