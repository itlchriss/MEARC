To determine if a sequence of moves can transform the starting string `start` into the ending string `end`, both of which are composed of characters 'L', 'R', and 'X', we need to check if it is possible to replace occurrences of 'XL' with 'LX' or 'RX' with 'XR'. If such transformations can be made, the output should be `True`.
