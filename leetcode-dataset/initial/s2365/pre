You are given a **0-indexed** array of positive integers `tasks`, representing tasks that need to be completed **in order**, where `tasks[i]` represents the **type** of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> task. You are also given a positive integer `space`, which represents the **minimum** number of days that must pass **after** the completion of a task before another task of the **same** type can be performed.
