a young patient (<70 years old) with no history of myocardial infarction, no clinical heart failure, stable hemodynamics, and normal renal function would have a GRACE score of around 90 (even if cardiac biomarkers are elevated and in-hospital revascularization is not performed) and a low-predicted 6-month mortality of < 3%.
high-risk patients (age > 80, hemodynamically unstable, overt congestive cardiac failure, renal impairment which was sometimes deemed a contraindication to percutanous coronary intervention because of contrast nephropathy)
