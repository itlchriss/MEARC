The lumbar lordosis angle, of the individuals with no spinal pathology was 45.9 ± 9.9 degrees.
PI higher than 85° are seen in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis as reported by Labelle et al.
All three groups showed higher LAs than healthy individuals: 52.4 ± 9.2 for individuals with spondylolysis without listhesis; 52.6 ± 15.4 for individuals with degenerative spondylolisthesis and 53.8 ± 7.3 for individuals with isthmic spondylolisthesis.
Other studies in the literature reported that the normal range of the pelvic incidence is between 40 to 65, sacral slope 30 to 50, the normal range of lumbar lordosis between 31 and 70 which in our study this parameters are within the ranges of world literature.
