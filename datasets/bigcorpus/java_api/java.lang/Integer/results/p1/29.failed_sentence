If a furry brown dog is running through the grassy area, a grey silky dog is sleeping in the grass, and a brown dog is looking on, then the unsigned magnitude is represented by a single zero character '0' ('\u0030'). However, if the brown dogs are playfully fighting on the sandy shore, the first character of the representation of the unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character.
