The value of this property is then parsed as an integer value, following the decode method, and a Integer object representing this value is returned. To summarize: If the property value starts with the two ASCII characters 0x or the ASCII character #, without a minus sign following it, then the remaining part is interpreted as a hexadecimal integer, just like the method valueOf(java.lang.String, int) with radix 16.
