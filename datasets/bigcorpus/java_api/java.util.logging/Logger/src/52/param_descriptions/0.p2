The sentence "handler - a logging Handler." can be rewritten in the context of the Java method "public void addHandler(Handler handler) throws SecurityException" as follows:

"The 'handler' parameter represents a logging Handler that needs to be added to the method, as per the 'addHandler' method signature."
