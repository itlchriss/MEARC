In the context of the Java method "public void logp(Level level, String sourceClass, String sourceMethod, Throwable thrown, Supplier<String> msgSupplier)", the sentence can be rewritten as:

"One of the identifiers for the message level, such as SEVERE, to be passed as an argument to the 'level' parameter in the logp method."
