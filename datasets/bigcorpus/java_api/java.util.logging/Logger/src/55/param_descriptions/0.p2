The sentence "useParentHandlers - true if output is to be sent to the logger's parent." can be rewritten in the context of the Java method "public void setUseParentHandlers(boolean useParentHandlers)" as follows:

This parameter, useParentHandlers, determines whether the output should be directed to the logger's parent when set to true.
