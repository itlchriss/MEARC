Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner, and the summary of Queue methods includes throwing an exception or returning a special value for insert, remove, and examine operations, as well as adding elements using add(e) or offer(e), removing elements using remove() or poll(), and examining elements using element() or peek().
