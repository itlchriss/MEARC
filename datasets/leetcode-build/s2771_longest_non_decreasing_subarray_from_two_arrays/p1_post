The returned value is an integer representing the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray in `nums3`.
The length of `nums3` is equal to the length of `nums1` and `nums2`.
The elements in `nums3` are either from `nums1` or `nums2`.
The subarray in `nums3` starting from index 0 and ending at index `k` (0 <= k < n) is non-decreasing.
The length of the longest non-decreasing subarray in `nums3` is maximized.
