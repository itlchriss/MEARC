Preconditions:
- The input `edges` is a 2D integer array.
- The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.
- Each element in `edges` is an array of length 2, representing an edge between two nodes.
- The nodes in `edges` are labeled from 1 to `n`.
- The given `edges` represent a valid star graph.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the center node of the star graph.
