Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have the same length `n`.
- The length `n` of the input arrays must be at least 1 and at most 1000.
- Each element in `nums1` and `nums2` must be an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to satisfy the conditions.
- If it is impossible to satisfy both conditions, the method returns -1.
- After the operations, `nums1[n - 1]` is equal to the maximum value among all elements of `nums1`.
- After the operations, `nums2[n - 1]` is equal to the maximum value among all elements of `nums2`.
