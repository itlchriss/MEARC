The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to satisfy the conditions.
If it is impossible to satisfy both conditions, the method returns -1.
After the operations, `nums1[n - 1]` is equal to the maximum value among all elements of `nums1`.
After the operations, `nums2[n - 1]` is equal to the maximum value among all elements of `nums2`.
