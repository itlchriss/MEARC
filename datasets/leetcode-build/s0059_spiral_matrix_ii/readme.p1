Preconditions:
- The input `n` must be a positive integer.
- The value of `n` must be between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The output `matrix` must be a 2D array of integers.
- The dimensions of the `matrix` must be `n x n`.
- The elements of the `matrix` must be filled in spiral order, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each element.
- The `matrix` must be filled in a clockwise spiral pattern.
- The `matrix` must be filled row by row, starting from the top-left corner and moving towards the right.
- The `matrix` must be filled in a spiral pattern until all elements from 1 to n^2 are filled.
- The `matrix` must be returned as the output of the method.
