Preconditions:
- The input array `vals` is not null.
- The input array `edges` is not null.
- The length of `vals` is equal to `n`.
- The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- The values in `vals` are integers.
- The values in `edges` are pairs of integers.
- The values in `edges` are valid indices of nodes in `vals`.
- The values in `edges` are distinct and do not contain duplicates.
- The values in `edges` form a valid tree.

Postconditions:
- The return value is an integer.
- The return value represents the number of distinct good paths in the tree.
- The return value is greater than or equal to 0.
- The return value is less than or equal to the total number of nodes in the tree.
- The return value is equal to the number of single-node paths in the tree if all nodes have the same value.
- The return value is equal to the number of paths from a node to itself if the node's value is the maximum value in the path.
- The return value is equal to the number of paths from a node to its parent if the node's value is less than or equal to the parent's value.
- The return value is equal to the sum of the number of paths from each node to its parent.
