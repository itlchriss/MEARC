The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a triplet of integers.
Each triplet in the solution set should satisfy the following conditions:
 - The indices `i`, `j`, and `k` of the triplet should be distinct (i != j, i != k, and j != k).
 - The sum of the three integers in the triplet should be equal to The solution set should not contain any duplicate triplets.
