Preconditions:
- The input array `coins` must have a length of `n`.
- The input array `edges` must have a length of `n - 1`.
- Each element in the input array `coins` must be either `0` or `1`.
- Each element in the input array `edges` must be a valid index of a node in the tree.
- Each element in the input array `edges` must be unique.
- The input array `edges` must represent a valid tree.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer representing the minimum number of edges needed to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex.
- The method should return `-1` if it is not possible to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex.
- The method should return `0` if there are no coins in the tree.
- The method should return `0` if there is only one vertex in the tree and it has a coin.
- The method should return `0` if there is only one vertex in the tree and it does not have a coin.
- The method should return the minimum number of edges needed to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex, considering all possible starting vertices in the tree.
