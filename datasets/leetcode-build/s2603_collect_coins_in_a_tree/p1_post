The method should return an integer representing the minimum number of edges needed to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex.
The method should return `-1` if it is not possible to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex.
The method should return `0` if there are no coins in the tree.
The method should return `0` if there is only one vertex in the tree and it has a coin.
The method should return `0` if there is only one vertex in the tree and it does not have a coin.
The method should return the minimum number of edges needed to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex, considering all possible starting vertices in the tree.
