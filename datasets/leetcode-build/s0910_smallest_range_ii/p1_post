The returned value is an integer.
The returned value is the minimum score of `nums` after changing the values at each index.
The values in the input array `nums` have been modified such that for each index `i`, `nums[i]` is either `nums[i] + k` or `nums[i] - k`.
The maximum element in the modified `nums` array is greater than or equal to the minimum element in the modified `nums` array.
The difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the modified `nums` array is minimized.
