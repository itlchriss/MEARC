The output `answer` is an array of length `seq.length`.
Each element in the `answer` array is either 0 or - The sum of the elements in the `answer` array is equal to `seq.length`.
The elements in the `answer` array represent the split of `seq` into two disjoint subsequences `A` and `B`, where `0` represents an element in `A` and `1` represents an element in `B`.
The split of `seq` into `A` and `B` is such that `max(depth(A), depth(B))` is minimized.
