Preconditions:
- The input `tiles` is a 2D integer array.
- Each element `tiles[i]` in `tiles` is an array of length 2, representing the range of white tiles.
- The values in `tiles[i]` are integers.
- The values in `tiles[i]` are non-negative.
- The values in `tiles[i]` are non-decreasing.
- The input `carpetLen` is an integer.
- The value of `carpetLen` is positive.
- The value of `carpetLen` is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The `tiles` array is non-empty.
- The length of `tiles` is less than or equal to 5 * 10^4.
- The `tiles` array does not contain overlapping ranges.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer.
- The returned value represents the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
- The returned value is non-negative.
- The returned value is less than or equal to the length of the longest range in `tiles`.
- The returned value is less than or equal to the length of the carpet (`carpetLen`).
- The returned value is the maximum possible number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
