Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer.
- `n` is less than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- The output is an integer array `answer`.
- `answer` contains two elements: `even` and `odd`.
- `even` represents the number of even indices in the binary representation of `n` with value - `odd` represents the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n` with value - The binary representation of `n` is calculated correctly.
- The indices in the binary representation are 0-indexed.
- The values of `even` and `odd` are correct based on the binary representation of `n`.
