Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is at least 3.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are distinct integers.

Postconditions:
- The output array is a rearrangement of the input array `nums`.
- For every index `i` in the range `1 <= i < nums.length - 1`, the average of `nums[i-1]` and `nums[i+1]` is not equal to `nums[i]`.
- The length of the output array is the same as the length of the input array `nums`.
- The elements in the output array are distinct integers.
- The elements in the output array are non-negative integers.
