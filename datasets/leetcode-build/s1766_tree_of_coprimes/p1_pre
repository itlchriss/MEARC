The input array `nums` is not null.
The input array `edges` is not null.
The length of `nums` is equal to `n`.
The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
Each element in `nums` is an integer between 1 and - Each element in `edges` is an array of length - Each element in `edges` is an array of integers between 0 and `n - 1`.
The values in `edges` represent valid edges in the tree.
The tree is connected and undirected.
The root of the tree is node
