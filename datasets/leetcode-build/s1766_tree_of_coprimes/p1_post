The output array `ans` is not null.
The length of `ans` is equal to `n`.
Each element in `ans` is an integer between -1 and `n - 1`.
The value of `ans[i]` represents the closest ancestor to node `i` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[ans[i]]` are coprime.
If there is no such ancestor, the value of `ans[i]` is -1.
