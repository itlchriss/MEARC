Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `edges` is not null.
- The length of `nums` is equal to `n`.
- The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in `nums` is an integer between 1 and - Each element in `edges` is an array of length - Each element in `edges` is an array of integers between 0 and `n - 1`.
- The values in `edges` represent valid edges in the tree.
- The tree is connected and undirected.
- The root of the tree is node 
Postconditions:
- The output array `ans` is not null.
- The length of `ans` is equal to `n`.
- Each element in `ans` is an integer between -1 and `n - 1`.
- The value of `ans[i]` represents the closest ancestor to node `i` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[ans[i]]` are coprime.
- If there is no such ancestor, the value of `ans[i]` is -1.
