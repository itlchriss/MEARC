Preconditions:
- The input `image` is a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`.
- Each element in the `image` matrix is either `0` or `1`.

Postconditions:
- The `image` matrix is flipped horizontally, meaning that each row is reversed.
- The flipped `image` matrix is inverted, meaning that each `0` is replaced by `1` and each `1` is replaced by `0`.
- The resulting `image` matrix is returned.
