The input matrix `grid` is a 2D integer array with dimensions `m x n`.
The input array `queries` is an integer array with size `k`.
The values in `grid` and `queries` are within the range of 1 to 10^6.
The dimensions of `grid` satisfy the constraints: 2 <= m, n <= 1000 and 4 <= m * n <= 10^5.
The size of `queries` satisfies the constraint: 1 <= k <= 10^4.
