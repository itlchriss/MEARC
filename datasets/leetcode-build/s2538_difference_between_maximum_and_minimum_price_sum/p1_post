The output is a long integer.
The output represents the maximum possible cost among all possible root choices.
The maximum possible cost is the difference between the maximum and minimum price sum amongst all paths starting at the root.
The root can be any node in the tree.
The maximum and minimum price sums are calculated by summing the prices of all nodes lying on the path from the root to a leaf node.
The maximum and minimum price sums are calculated for all possible paths starting at the root.
The difference between the maximum and minimum price sums is the maximum possible cost.
