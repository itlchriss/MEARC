Preconditions:
- The input `heights` is a 2D array of integers.
- The dimensions of `heights` are `rows x columns`.
- The top-left cell of `heights` is represented by `(0, 0)`.
- The bottom-right cell of `heights` is represented by `(rows-1, columns-1)`.
- The input `heights` is a valid grid with positive integer values.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
- The returned value is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
- The returned value is the minimum possible effort to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
