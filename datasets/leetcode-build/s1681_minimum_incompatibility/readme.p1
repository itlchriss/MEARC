Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of `nums` is divisible by `k`.
- The value of `k` is between 1 and the length of `nums`, inclusive.
- The values in `nums` are between 1 and the length of `nums`, inclusive.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum possible sum of incompatibilities of the `k` subsets after distributing the array optimally.
- If it is not possible to distribute the array into `k` subsets where no two elements are equal in the same subset, the method returns -1.
