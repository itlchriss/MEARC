The input `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
The input `edges` is a 2D array where each element `edges[i]` is an array of size 2 representing an undirected edge between two nodes.
The elements in `edges` are valid node indices, i.e., `1 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n`.
The graph represented by `n` and `edges` is undirected and connected.
