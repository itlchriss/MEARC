1. The method returns an integer value.
2. The returned value is the result of evaluating the arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation represented by the input `tokens`.
3. The returned value is the correct evaluation of the expression, considering the valid operators and operand types.
4. The returned value is calculated by performing the arithmetic operations in the correct order, following the Reverse Polish Notation rules.
5. The returned value is the correct result, even when division is performed between two integers (truncating toward zero).
6. The returned value is the correct result, even when there are multiple levels of nested expressions.
7. The returned value is the correct result, even when there are negative numbers involved in the expression.
