The length of the returned `answer` array must be equal to the length of the `queries` array.
Each element in the `answer` array must be either `true` or `false`.
If `answer[i]` is `true`, there is a path between cities `a_i` and `b_i`.
If `answer[i]` is `false`, there is no path between cities `a_i` and `b_i`.
