Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is at least 2.
- The integer `k` is not null.
- The integer `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a boolean value indicating whether `nums` has a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`.
- If `nums` has a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`, the method returns `true`.
- If `nums` does not have a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`, the method returns `false`.
