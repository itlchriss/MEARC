The method returns an integer representing the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays.
The two subarrays must have lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen`.
The two subarrays must not overlap.
The subarray with length `firstLen` could occur before or after the subarray with length `secondLen`.
