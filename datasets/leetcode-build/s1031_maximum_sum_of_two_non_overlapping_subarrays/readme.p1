Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` must not be null.
- The length of `nums` must be greater than or equal to `firstLen + secondLen`.
- The values in `nums` must be non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays.
- The two subarrays must have lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen`.
- The two subarrays must not overlap.
- The subarray with length `firstLen` could occur before or after the subarray with length `secondLen`.
