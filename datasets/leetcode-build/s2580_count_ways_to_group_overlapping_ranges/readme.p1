Preconditions:
- The input `ranges` is a 2D integer array.
- Each element `ranges[i]` is an array of length - The values in `ranges[i]` represent the start and end of a range, where `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
- The ranges in `ranges` may overlap.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the total number of ways to split `ranges` into two groups.
- The result is modulo `10^9 + 7`.
