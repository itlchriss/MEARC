Preconditions:
- The input strings `num1` and `num2` must be valid complex numbers.
- The real part of `num1` and `num2` must be integers in the range [-100, 100].
- The imaginary part of `num1` and `num2` must be integers in the range [-100, 100].

Postconditions:
- The method should return a string representing the multiplication of `num1` and `num2` in the form "real+imaginaryi".
- The real part of the result should be an integer.
- The imaginary part of the result should be an integer.
- The result should be a valid complex number.
