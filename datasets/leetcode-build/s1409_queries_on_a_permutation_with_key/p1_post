The output array is not null.
The length of the output array is equal to the length of the input array `queries`.
The output array contains integers between 0 and `m-1`.
For each element `queries[i]` in the input array, the corresponding element in the output array is the position of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P` after processing all the queries.
