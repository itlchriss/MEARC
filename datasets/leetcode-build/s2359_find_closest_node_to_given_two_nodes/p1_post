The returned value must be an integer.
The returned value must be the index of a node that can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`.
The maximum distance between `node1` and the returned node, and between `node2` and the returned node, must be minimized.
If there are multiple nodes that satisfy the above condition, the node with the smallest index must be returned.
If no node can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`, `-1` must be returned.
