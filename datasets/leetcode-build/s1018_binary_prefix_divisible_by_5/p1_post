The output list `answer` is not null.
The length of the output list `answer` is equal to the length of the input array `nums`.
Each element in the output list `answer` is either true or false.
For each index `i` in the output list `answer`, if the number represented by the subarray `nums[0..i]` is divisible by 5, then the corresponding element in the output list `answer` is true. Otherwise, it is false.
