The method returns an integer representing the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
The returned value is greater than or equal to 0.
The returned value is less than or equal to the length `n` of the input arrays.
The car fleets are determined based on the positions and speeds of the cars.
A car fleet is a non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed.
If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.
