Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the input array `nums` must be greater than or equal to - The value of `indexDifference` must be greater than or equal to - The value of `valueDifference` must be greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- If there are two indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions `abs(i - j) >= indexDifference` and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference`, then the method should return an integer array `answer` containing the values of `i` and `j`.
- If there are multiple choices for the two indices, the method can return any of them.
- If there are no two indices that satisfy the conditions, the method should return the integer array `[-1, -1]`.
