Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is at least - The elements in the input array `nums` are positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the maximum difference between two elements in the input array `nums`.
- If there is no valid pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] < nums[j]`, the method returns -1.
