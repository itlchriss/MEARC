The method should return the total number of powerful integers in the range `[start..finish]`.
Other behavioral requirements:
The method should consider an integer `x` as powerful if it ends with the string `s` and each digit in `x` is at most `limit`.
The method should count the number of powerful integers in the range `[start..finish]`.
The method should not count any integer that is smaller than `start` or larger than `finish`.
The method should not count any integer that does not end with the string `s`.
The method should not count any integer that has a digit greater than `limit`.
