Preconditions:
- The input integers `start`, `finish`, and `limit` must be valid and within the specified constraints.
- The input string `s` must be a valid positive integer and must not have leading zeros.

Postconditions:
- The method should return the total number of powerful integers in the range `[start..finish]`.

Other behavioral requirements:
- The method should consider an integer `x` as powerful if it ends with the string `s` and each digit in `x` is at most `limit`.
- The method should count the number of powerful integers in the range `[start..finish]`.
- The method should not count any integer that is smaller than `start` or larger than `finish`.
- The method should not count any integer that does not end with the string `s`.
- The method should not count any integer that has a digit greater than `limit`.
