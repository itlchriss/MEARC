The grid must be a valid m x n grid.
The grid must contain only characters '.', '#', 'S', 'T', or 'B'.
There must be only one character 'S', 'B', and 'T' in the grid.
The box 'B' and the target cell 'T' must be present in the grid.
The player 'S' must be able to move up, down, left, or right in the grid if it is a floor (empty cell).
The box 'B' can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a push.
The player cannot walk through the box.
