Preconditions:
- The input arrays `arr1` and `arr2` must not be null.
- The lengths of `arr1` and `arr2` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements of `arr1` and `arr2` must be non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned value is the XOR sum of the list containing the result of `arr1[i] AND arr2[j]` for every `(i, j)` pair where `0 <= i < arr1.length` and `0 <= j < arr2.length`.
