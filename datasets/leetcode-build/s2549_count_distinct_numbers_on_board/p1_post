The method `distinctIntegers` returns an integer representing the number of distinct integers present on the board after 10^9 days have elapsed.
The board initially contains the number `n`.
For each number `x` present on the board, all numbers `1 <= i <= n` such that `x % i == 1` are added to the board.
Once a number is placed on the board, it remains on the board until the end.
The distinct numbers on the board after 10^9 days have elapsed are returned.
