The output matrix `answer` is not null.
The number of rows in the output matrix `answer` is equal to the number of rows in the input matrix `mat`.
The number of columns in the output matrix `answer` is equal to the number of columns in the input matrix `mat`.
For each element `answer[i][j]` in the output matrix `answer`, the value is equal to the sum of all elements `mat[r][c]` where `i - k <= r <= i + k`, `j - k <= c <= j + k`, and `(r, c)` is a valid position in the matrix.
