Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of gardens.
- The input `paths` is a 2D array where each element `paths[i]` is an array of size 2, representing a bidirectional path between two gardens.
- The elements in `paths` are valid garden labels, i.e., they are integers between 1 and `n`.
- Each garden has at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Postconditions:
- The output `answer` is an array of size `n` where each element `answer[i]` represents the type of flower planted in the `(i+1)th` garden.
- For any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.
- The flower types are denoted by the integers 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- The output `answer` is a valid choice of flower types that satisfies the above conditions.
