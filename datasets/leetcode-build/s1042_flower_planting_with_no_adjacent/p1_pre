The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of gardens.
The input `paths` is a 2D array where each element `paths[i]` is an array of size 2, representing a bidirectional path between two gardens.
The elements in `paths` are valid garden labels, i.e., they are integers between 1 and `n`.
Each garden has at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.
