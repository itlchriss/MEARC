Preconditions:
- The input integers `x` and `y` must be valid Cartesian coordinates.
- The input array `points` must not be null.
- The length of the input array `points` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- Each element in the input array `points` must be an array of length 2.

Postconditions:
- The output integer must be the index of a valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from the current location.
- If there are multiple valid points with the smallest Manhattan distance, the output must be the valid point with the smallest index.
- If there are no valid points, the output must be -1.
