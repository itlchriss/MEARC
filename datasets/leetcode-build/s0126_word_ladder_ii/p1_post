The method returns a list of lists of strings.
Each list in the returned list represents a shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
Each transformation sequence starts with `beginWord` and ends with `endWord`.
Each adjacent pair of words in a transformation sequence differs by a single letter.
Each word in a transformation sequence is in `wordList`.
If no valid transformation sequence exists, an empty list is returned.
