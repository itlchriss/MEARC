Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums` and `quantity` are not null.
- The length of `nums` is equal to `n`.
- The length of `quantity` is equal to `m`.
- The values in `nums` are integers between 1 and 1000.
- The values in `quantity` are integers between 1 and 100000.
- The number of unique values in `nums` is at most 50.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to distribute `nums` according to the given conditions.
- If the method returns `true`, it means that it is possible to distribute `nums` and satisfy all customers.
- If the method returns `false`, it means that it is not possible to distribute `nums` and satisfy all customers.
- The distribution of `nums` should ensure that each customer gets exactly the quantity of integers specified in `quantity`.
- The integers received by each customer should be equal.
- The distribution should satisfy all customers, meaning that every customer should receive the specified quantity of integers.
