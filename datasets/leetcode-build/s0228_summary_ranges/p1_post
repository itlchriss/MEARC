The output is a list of strings.
Each element in the output list covers exactly one number from the input array.
The output list is sorted in ascending order.
Each range in the output list is represented as a string.
If a range `[a,b]` has `a != b`, it is represented as `"a->b"`.
If a range `[a,b]` has `a == b`, it is represented as `"a"`.
There is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in the input array.
