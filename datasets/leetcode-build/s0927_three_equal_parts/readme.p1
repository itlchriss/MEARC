Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` is not null.
- The length of `arr` is at least 3.
- Each element in `arr` is either 0 or 1.

Postconditions:
- If it is possible to divide `arr` into three non-empty parts such that all three parts represent the same binary value, return an array `[i, j]` where `i + 1 < j`. `i` represents the index of the last element in the first part, and `j` represents the index of the first element in the third part.
- If it is not possible to divide `arr` into three non-empty parts with equal binary values, return `[-1, -1]`.
