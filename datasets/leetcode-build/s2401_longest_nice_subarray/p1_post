The returned value is an integer representing the length of the longest nice subarray.
The returned value is greater than or equal to 1.
The returned value is less than or equal to the length of the input array `nums`.
The returned value is the maximum length such that the bitwise AND of every pair of elements in the subarray is equal to 0.
The returned value is the length of a subarray that satisfies the conditions:
- The bitwise AND of every pair of elements in the subarray is equal to 0.
- The subarray is contiguous.
If there are multiple subarrays with the same maximum length, any of them can be chosen as the longest nice subarray.
