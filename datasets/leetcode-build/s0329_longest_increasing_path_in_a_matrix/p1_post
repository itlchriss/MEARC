1. The method returns an integer representing the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix.
2. The returned length is greater than or equal to 1.
3. The returned length is less than or equal to the total number of cells in the matrix.
4. The longest increasing path is a sequence of cells in the matrix where each cell has a value greater than the previous cell in the sequence.
5. The longest increasing path does not include any cells that are outside the boundary of the matrix.
6. The longest increasing path does not include any cells that are reached by moving diagonally.
7. The longest increasing path may include cells that are reached by moving left, right, up, or down from the current cell.
8. The longest increasing path may include cells that are reached by moving in any combination of left, right, up, or down directions.
