The method should return an integer representing the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to cell (n - 1, n - 1).
The safeness factor of a path is defined as the minimum Manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.
The method should consider all possible paths from cell (0, 0) to cell (n - 1, n - 1).
The method should calculate the safeness factor for each path and return the maximum safeness factor.
