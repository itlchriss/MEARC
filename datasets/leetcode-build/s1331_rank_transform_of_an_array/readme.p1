Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` is not null.
- The length of the input array `arr` is not negative.
- The elements in the input array `arr` are integers.
- The elements in the input array `arr` are within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.

Postconditions:
- The output array `result` is not null.
- The length of the output array `result` is the same as the input array `arr`.
- The elements in the output array `result` are integers.
- The elements in the output array `result` represent the ranks of the corresponding elements in the input array `arr`.
- The ranks in the output array `result` are integers starting from 1.
- The larger the element in the input array `arr`, the larger the rank in the output array `result`.
