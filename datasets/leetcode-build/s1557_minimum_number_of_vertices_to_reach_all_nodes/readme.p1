Preconditions:
- The input `n` represents the number of vertices in the graph and must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- The input `edges` represents the directed edges in the graph and must be a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the source and destination vertices of the edge.
- The graph is a directed acyclic graph.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a list of integers representing the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable.
- The returned list may contain any order of vertices.
- The returned list must include all vertices that are not reachable from any other node.
