The method returns an integer representing the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < dominoes.length` and `dominoes[i]` is equivalent to `dominoes[j]`.
The method correctly determines the equivalence of two dominoes based on the given conditions: either (`a == c` and `b == d`), or (`a == d` and `b == c`).
The method handles the case where there are no equivalent domino pairs and returns 0.
The method handles the case where there is only one equivalent domino pair and returns 1.
The method handles the case where there are multiple equivalent domino pairs and returns the correct count.
