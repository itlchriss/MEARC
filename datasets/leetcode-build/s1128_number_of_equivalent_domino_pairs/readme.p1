Preconditions:
- The input `dominoes` is a non-empty list of arrays, where each array has a length of 2.
- The elements in each array of `dominoes` are integers between 1 and 9.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < dominoes.length` and `dominoes[i]` is equivalent to `dominoes[j]`.
- The method correctly determines the equivalence of two dominoes based on the given conditions: either (`a == c` and `b == d`), or (`a == d` and `b == c`).
- The method handles the case where there are no equivalent domino pairs and returns 0.
- The method handles the case where there is only one equivalent domino pair and returns 1.
- The method handles the case where there are multiple equivalent domino pairs and returns the correct count.
