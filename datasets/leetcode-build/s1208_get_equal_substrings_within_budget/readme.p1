Preconditions:
- The lengths of strings `s` and `t` are the same.
- The length of string `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The maximum cost `maxCost` is between 0 and 1,000,000 (inclusive).
- Strings `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.
- If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, the method returns 0.
