Behavioural requirements (preconditions and postconditions) for the Java method `public int[] cycleLengthQueries(int n, int[][] queries)`:
The input `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive).
The input `queries` is a 2D integer array of length `m`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
Each element `queries[i]` in the `queries` array is an array of length 2.
The values `queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]` are integers between 1 and 2^n - 1 (inclusive).
The values `queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]` are not equal.
