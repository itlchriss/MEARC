The method returns an array `answer` of length `m`.
Each element `answer[i]` in the `answer` array is an integer representing the length of the cycle in the graph after adding the edge between nodes `queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]`.
After processing each query, the added edge between nodes `queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]` is removed from the graph.
