Behavioural requirements (preconditions and postconditions) for the Java method `public int[] cycleLengthQueries(int n, int[][] queries)`:

Preconditions:
- The input `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive).
- The input `queries` is a 2D integer array of length `m`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- Each element `queries[i]` in the `queries` array is an array of length 2.
- The values `queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]` are integers between 1 and 2^n - 1 (inclusive).
- The values `queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]` are not equal.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an array `answer` of length `m`.
- Each element `answer[i]` in the `answer` array is an integer representing the length of the cycle in the graph after adding the edge between nodes `queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]`.
- After processing each query, the added edge between nodes `queries[i][0]` and `queries[i][1]` is removed from the graph.
