The returned value is an integer.
The returned value is the minimum integer such that when all the integers larger than it in the input array `arr` are changed to be equal to it, the sum of the array is as close as possible to the target value `target`.
If there are multiple integers that satisfy the above condition, the returned value is the minimum among them.
