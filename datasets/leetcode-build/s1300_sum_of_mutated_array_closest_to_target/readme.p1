Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` is not null.
- The length of the input array `arr` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The target value `target` is greater than or equal to 1.

Postconditions:
- The returned value is an integer.
- The returned value is the minimum integer such that when all the integers larger than it in the input array `arr` are changed to be equal to it, the sum of the array is as close as possible to the target value `target`.
- If there are multiple integers that satisfy the above condition, the returned value is the minimum among them.
