The output is an integer representing the minimum value of `nums[i]` that can be used to destroy the maximum number of targets.
The output is one of the elements in the input array `nums`.
The output is the minimum value that can destroy the maximum number of targets.
The output is the value that allows the machine to destroy all targets with values that can be represented as `nums[i] + c * space`, where `c` is any non-negative integer.
The output is the value that maximizes the number of targets destroyed.
