Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are positive integers.
- The input integer `space` is a positive integer.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the minimum value of `nums[i]` that can be used to destroy the maximum number of targets.
- The output is one of the elements in the input array `nums`.
- The output is the minimum value that can destroy the maximum number of targets.
- The output is the value that allows the machine to destroy all targets with values that can be represented as `nums[i] + c * space`, where `c` is any non-negative integer.
- The output is the value that maximizes the number of targets destroyed.
