Preconditions:
1. The input matrices `mat` and `target` must have the same dimensions.
2. The dimensions of `mat` and `target` must be square matrices (n x n).
3. The values in `mat` and `target` must be either 0 or 1.

Postconditions:
1. The method should return `true` if it is possible to make `mat` equal to `target` by rotating `mat` in 90-degree increments.
2. The method should return `false` if it is not possible to make `mat` equal to `target` by rotating `mat` in 90-degree increments.
