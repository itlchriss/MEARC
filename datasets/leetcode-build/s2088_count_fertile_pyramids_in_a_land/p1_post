The method returns the total number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots found in the grid.
A pyramidal plot is a set of cells that:
- Contains more than 1 cell.
- All cells in the plot are fertile (1).
- The apex of the pyramid is the topmost cell of the pyramid.
- The height of the pyramid is the number of rows it covers.
- The plot comprises cells (i, j) where r <= i <= r + h - 1 and c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r), where (r, c) is the apex of the pyramid and h is its height.
An inverse pyramidal plot is a set of cells that:
- Contains more than 1 cell.
- All cells in the plot are fertile (1).
- The apex of the inverse pyramid is the bottommost cell of the inverse pyramid.
- The height of the inverse pyramid is the number of rows it covers.
- The plot comprises cells (i, j) where r - h + 1 <= i <= r and c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i), where (r, c) is the apex of the inverse pyramid and h is its height.
