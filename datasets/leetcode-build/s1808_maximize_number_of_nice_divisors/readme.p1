Preconditions:
- The input `primeFactors` is a positive integer.
- The value of `primeFactors` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of nice divisors of `n`.
- The returned value is the maximum possible number of nice divisors for a positive integer `n` that satisfies the given conditions.
- The returned value is modulo 10^9 + 7.
