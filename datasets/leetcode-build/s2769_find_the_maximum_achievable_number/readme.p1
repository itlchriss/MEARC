Preconditions:
- The method takes two integer parameters, `num` and `t`.
- `num` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned value is the maximum achievable number.
- The maximum achievable number can be obtained by increasing or decreasing `x` by 1, and simultaneously increasing or decreasing `num` by 1, no more than `t` times.
- The maximum achievable number is equal to `num` after applying the operations.
- There exists at least one achievable number.
