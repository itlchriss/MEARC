Preconditions:
- The grid size `n` must be a positive integer.
- The lamp positions `lamps` must be a 2D array where each element is a pair of integers representing the row and column indices of a lamp in the grid.
- The lamp positions in `lamps` must be within the bounds of the grid.
- The queries `queries` must be a 2D array where each element is a pair of integers representing the row and column indices of a query in the grid.
- The query positions in `queries` must be within the bounds of the grid.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an array of integers `ans` where `ans[j]` is 1 if the cell in the j-th query was illuminated, or 0 if the lamp was not illuminated.
- After answering a query, the lamp at the corresponding position in the grid and its 8 adjacent lamps (if they exist) should be turned off.
