Preconditions:
- The method takes three integer parameters: `n`, `k`, and `maxPts`.
- `n` represents the maximum number of points Alice can have.
- `k` represents the minimum number of points Alice needs to stop drawing numbers.
- `maxPts` represents the maximum number of points Alice can gain in each draw.
- `0 <= k <= n <= 10^4` and `1 <= maxPts <= 10^4`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a double value representing the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.
- The returned probability is within `10^-5` of the actual answer.
