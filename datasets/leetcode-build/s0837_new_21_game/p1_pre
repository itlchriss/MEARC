The method takes three integer parameters: `n`, `k`, and `maxPts`.
`n` represents the maximum number of points Alice can have.
`k` represents the minimum number of points Alice needs to stop drawing numbers.
`maxPts` represents the maximum number of points Alice can gain in each draw.
`0 <= k <= n <= 10^4` and `1 <= maxPts <= 10^4`.
