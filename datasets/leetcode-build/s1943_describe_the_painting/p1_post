The output is a 2D array `painting`.
Each element `painting[j]` is an array of length 3.
The start value `left_j` of each segment in `painting` is less than the end value `right_j`.
The mixed color sum `mix_j` of each segment in `painting` is the sum of the mixed colors in the corresponding segments of the input `segments`.
The segments in `painting` are non-overlapping.
The segments in `painting` represent the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of mixed colors.
