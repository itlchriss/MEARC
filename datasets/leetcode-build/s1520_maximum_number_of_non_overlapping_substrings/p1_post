The output is a list of strings.
The output list is not null.
The output list is not empty.
The output list contains only non-empty substrings of `s`.
The substrings in the output list do not overlap.
For any two substrings `s[i..j]` and `s[k..l]` in the output list, either `j < k` or `i > l` is true.
For any substring `s[i..j]` in the output list, if it contains a certain character `c`, it must also contain all occurrences of `c`.
The output list contains the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions.
If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, the output list is the one with minimum total length.
The output list is in any order.
