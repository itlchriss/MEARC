Preconditions:
1. The input matrix `cells` must be a 2D array.
2. The dimensions of the input matrix `cells` must be equal to `row` x `col`.
3. The values in the input matrix `cells` must be unique.
4. The values in the input matrix `cells` must be within the range of 1 to `row` for the row indices and 1 to `col` for the column indices.
5. The input integers `row` and `col` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 20000.
6. The product of `row` and `col` must be greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 20000.

Postconditions:
1. The method should return an integer representing the last day where it is possible to walk from the top to the bottom by only walking on land cells.
2. The returned value should be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the number of cells in the matrix.
3. The returned value should be the maximum day number where it is possible to cross from top to bottom by only walking on land cells.
4. The method should not modify the input matrix `cells` or any other input parameters.
