Preconditions:
- The input values `rows` and `cols` must be integers greater than or equal to 1.
- The input values `rStart` and `cStart` must be integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than `rows` and `cols` respectively.

Postconditions:
- The output is a 2D array of integers representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.
- The output array has a length of `rows * cols`.
- Each element in the output array is a 1D array of length 2, representing the coordinates of a position in the grid.
- The coordinates of each position in the output array are within the boundaries of the grid.
- The positions in the output array are visited in a clockwise spiral shape, starting from the cell `(rStart, cStart)` and moving east.
