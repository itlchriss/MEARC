The output list is not null.
The output list contains `k` integers.
The output list is sorted in ascending order.
The integers in the output list are the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array `arr`.
For any two integers `a` and `b` in the output list, if `|a - x| < |b - x|`, then `a` appears before `b` in the output list.
For any two integers `a` and `b` in the output list, if `|a - x| == |b - x|` and `a < b`, then `a` appears before `b` in the output list.
