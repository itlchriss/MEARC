Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` is not null.
- The input array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- The input integer `k` is greater than or equal to - The input integer `k` is less than or equal to the length of the array `arr`.
- The input integer `x` is within the range of the minimum and maximum values in the array `arr`.

Postconditions:
- The output list is not null.
- The output list contains `k` integers.
- The output list is sorted in ascending order.
- The integers in the output list are the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array `arr`.
- For any two integers `a` and `b` in the output list, if `|a - x| < |b - x|`, then `a` appears before `b` in the output list.
- For any two integers `a` and `b` in the output list, if `|a - x| == |b - x|` and `a < b`, then `a` appears before `b` in the output list.
