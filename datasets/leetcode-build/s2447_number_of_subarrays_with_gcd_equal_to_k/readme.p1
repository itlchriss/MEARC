Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are positive integers.
- The input integer `k` is a positive integer.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of subarrays where the greatest common divisor of the subarray's elements is `k`.
- The method returns 0 if there are no subarrays where `k` is the greatest common divisor of all the subarray's elements.
- The method correctly counts the number of subarrays where `k` is the greatest common divisor of all the subarray's elements.
- The method does not modify the input array `nums`.
- The method terminates and returns a result in a reasonable amount of time for inputs within the given constraints.
