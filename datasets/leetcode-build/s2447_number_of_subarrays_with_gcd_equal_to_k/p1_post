The method returns an integer representing the number of subarrays where the greatest common divisor of the subarray's elements is `k`.
The method returns 0 if there are no subarrays where `k` is the greatest common divisor of all the subarray's elements.
The method correctly counts the number of subarrays where `k` is the greatest common divisor of all the subarray's elements.
The method does not modify the input array `nums`.
The method terminates and returns a result in a reasonable amount of time for inputs within the given constraints.
