Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

Postconditions:
- The output is a 2D sorted list of prime number pairs.
- Each pair `[x, y]` in the output satisfies the following conditions:
  - `1 <= x <= y <= n`
  - `x + y == n`
  - `x` and `y` are prime numbers.
- The list is sorted in increasing order of `x`.
- If there are no prime number pairs that satisfy the conditions, the output is an empty array.
