The method returns an integer representing the maximum number of four-person groups that can be assigned on the cinema seats.
A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats in one single row.
Seats across an aisle are not considered to be adjacent.
If an aisle splits a four-person group in the middle, there will be two people on each side of the aisle.
The returned maximum number of four-person groups is based on the given `reservedSeats` and the available seats in the cinema.
