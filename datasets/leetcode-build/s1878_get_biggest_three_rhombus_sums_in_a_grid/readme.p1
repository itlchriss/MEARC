Preconditions:
- The input grid is a 2D integer matrix.
- The dimensions of the grid are m x n, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
- The values in the grid are positive integers.
- The dimensions of the grid are within the constraints: 1 <= m, n <= 50.
- The values in the grid are within the constraints: 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an array of integers.
- The array contains the three biggest distinct rhombus sums in descending order.
- If there are less than three distinct values, the array contains all of them.
