Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are not null.
- The lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` are greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements of `nums1` and `nums2` are positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The sum of elements in `nums1` is equal to the sum of elements in `nums2`.
- All the zeros in `nums1` and `nums2` have been replaced with strictly positive integers.
- The returned value is the minimum equal sum that can be obtained.
- If it is impossible to make the sum of both arrays equal, the returned value is -1.
