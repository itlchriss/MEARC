The sum of elements in `nums1` is equal to the sum of elements in `nums2`.
All the zeros in `nums1` and `nums2` have been replaced with strictly positive integers.
The returned value is the minimum equal sum that can be obtained.
If it is impossible to make the sum of both arrays equal, the returned value is -1.
