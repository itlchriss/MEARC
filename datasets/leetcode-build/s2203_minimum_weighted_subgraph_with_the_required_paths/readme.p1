Preconditions:
- The number of nodes `n` must be at least - The number of edges `edges.length` can be any non-negative integer.
- Each edge `edges[i]` must have exactly 3 elements.
- The source nodes `src1`, `src2`, and the destination node `dest` must be distinct.
- The weights of the edges `weight[i]` must be positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long value representing the minimum weight of a subgraph.
- If a subgraph exists that allows reaching the destination node `dest` from both source nodes `src1` and `src2`, the method returns the minimum weight.
- If no such subgraph exists, the method returns -1.
