- The rotated matrix is stored in the same input matrix.
- The dimensions of the rotated matrix remain the same as the input matrix.
- The elements in each row of the rotated matrix are in reverse order compared to the input matrix.
- The elements in each column of the rotated matrix are in the same order as the input matrix.
