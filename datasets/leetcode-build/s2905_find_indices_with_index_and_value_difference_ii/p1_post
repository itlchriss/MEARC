If there exist two indices `i` and `j` such that `abs(i - j) >= indexDifference` and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference`, then the method should return an integer array `answer` containing the indices `i` and `j`.
If there are multiple choices for the two indices, the method can return any valid pair of indices.
If there are no two indices that satisfy the conditions, the method should return the integer array `[-1, -1]`.
