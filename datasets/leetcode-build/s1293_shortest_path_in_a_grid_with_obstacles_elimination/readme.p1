Preconditions:
- The input grid is a valid m x n integer matrix.
- The grid contains only 0s and 1s.
- The upper left corner (0, 0) and the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1) are both empty cells (0s).
- The value of k is a positive integer.
- The value of k is less than or equal to the total number of cells in the grid (m * n).

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner to the lower right corner, considering the given constraints.
- If it is not possible to find a walk from the upper left corner to the lower right corner while eliminating at most k obstacles, the method returns -1.
