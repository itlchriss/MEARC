Preconditions:
- The input matrix `mat` is not null.
- The input matrix `mat` is a 2D array of integers.
- The input matrix `mat` has at least one row and one column.
- The input matrix `mat` has dimensions `m x n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- The values in the input matrix `mat` are positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The output matrix is a 2D array of integers.
- The output matrix has the same dimensions as the input matrix `mat`.
- Each matrix diagonal in the output matrix is sorted in ascending order.
- The values in each matrix diagonal are the same as the values in the corresponding matrix diagonal of the input matrix `mat`.
- The values in each row and column of the output matrix are in the same order as the corresponding row and column of the input matrix `mat`, except for the sorted matrix diagonals.
