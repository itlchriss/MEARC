The output matrix is a 2D array of integers.
The output matrix has the same dimensions as the input matrix `mat`.
Each matrix diagonal in the output matrix is sorted in ascending order.
The values in each matrix diagonal are the same as the values in the corresponding matrix diagonal of the input matrix `mat`.
The values in each row and column of the output matrix are in the same order as the corresponding row and column of the input matrix `mat`, except for the sorted matrix diagonals.
