Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buildings.
- The input `requests` is a non-empty array of length `m` where each element is an array of length 2 representing a transfer request.
- Each transfer request in `requests` is valid, meaning the values of `from_i` and `to_i` are between 0 and `n-1`, inclusive.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum number of achievable requests.
- The maximum number of achievable requests is determined by finding a combination of transfers that results in a net change of zero for each building.
- The method considers all possible combinations of transfers to find the maximum number of achievable requests.
