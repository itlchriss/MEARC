Preconditions:
1. The input array `nums` must not be null.
2. The length of the input array `nums` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Postconditions:
1. The method returns an integer value representing the maximum difference between two successive elements in the sorted form of the input array `nums`.
2. If the input array `nums` contains less than two elements, the method returns 0.
3. The algorithm used by the method runs in linear time.
4. The algorithm used by the method uses linear extra space.
5. The input array `nums` remains unchanged after the method is executed.
