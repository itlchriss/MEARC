The returned array is not null.
The length of the returned array is equal to the sum of all the even-indexed elements in `nums`.
The values in the returned array are the concatenation of sublists generated from adjacent pairs of elements in `nums`.
The sublists are generated by repeating the value of the odd-indexed element in the pair, the number of times specified by the even-indexed element in the pair.
The sublists are concatenated from left to right.
