The method returns an integer value representing the minimum possible absolute difference.
The absolute difference is calculated by finding the difference between the sums of the two arrays obtained after partitioning the input array `nums`.
The two arrays obtained after partitioning the input array `nums` have a length of `n`.
The sum of the elements in the first array plus the sum of the elements in the second array is equal to the sum of all elements in the input array `nums`.
The absolute difference is minimized, meaning there is no other partitioning of the input array `nums` that results in a smaller absolute difference.
