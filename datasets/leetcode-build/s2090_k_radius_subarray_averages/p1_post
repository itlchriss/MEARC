The output array `avgs` is not null.
The output array `avgs` has a length `n`.
For each index `i` in the range [0, n-1], `avgs[i]` is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index `i`.
If there are less than `k` elements before or after the index `i`, then `avgs[i]` is -- The k-radius average is calculated using integer division, which truncates towards zero.
