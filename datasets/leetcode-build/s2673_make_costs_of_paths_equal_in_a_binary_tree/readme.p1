Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a perfect binary tree.
- The input `cost` is a 0-indexed integer array of size `n` representing the cost of each node in the tree.
- The length of `cost` is equal to `n`.
- Each element in `cost` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
- The number of nodes in the tree is one less than a power of 2.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of increments needed to make the cost of paths from the root to each leaf node equal.
