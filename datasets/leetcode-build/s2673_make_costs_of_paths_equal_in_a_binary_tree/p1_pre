The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in a perfect binary tree.
The input `cost` is a 0-indexed integer array of size `n` representing the cost of each node in the tree.
The length of `cost` is equal to `n`.
Each element in `cost` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
The number of nodes in the tree is one less than a power of 2.
