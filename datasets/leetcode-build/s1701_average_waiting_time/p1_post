The method returns a double value representing the average waiting time of all customers.
The average waiting time is calculated by summing up the waiting times of all customers and dividing it by the total number of customers.
The waiting time for each customer is calculated by subtracting the arrival time of the customer from the time when the chef finishes preparing the order for that customer.
The waiting times are calculated in the order the customers were given in the input array `customers`.
