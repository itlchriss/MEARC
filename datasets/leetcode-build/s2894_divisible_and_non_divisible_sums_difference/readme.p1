Preconditions:
- The input integers `n` and `m` must be positive.
- `n` and `m` must be integers.
- `n` and `m` must be within the range of 1 to 1000.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer value.
- The returned value should be equal to `num1 - num2`, where `num1` is the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` that are not divisible by `m`, and `num2` is the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` that are divisible by `m`.
