Preconditions:
- The values of m and n must be positive integers.
- The values of introvertsCount and extrovertsCount must be non-negative integers.
- The sum of introvertsCount and extrovertsCount must be less than or equal to the total number of cells in the grid (m * n).

Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer representing the maximum possible grid happiness.
- The grid happiness is calculated by summing the happiness of each person in the grid.
- The happiness of an introvert is calculated as 120 (starting happiness) minus 30 multiplied by the number of neighbors (introvert or extrovert).
- The happiness of an extrovert is calculated as 40 (starting happiness) plus 20 multiplied by the number of neighbors (introvert or extrovert).
- The neighbors of a person are the cells directly adjacent to their cell (north, east, south, and west).
- The happiness of each person should be calculated correctly based on their type (introvert or extrovert) and the number of neighbors they have.
- The maximum possible grid happiness should be determined correctly based on the given constraints.
