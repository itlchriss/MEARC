The binary matrix is initialized with all values set to 0.
The `flip` method returns a random index `[i, j]` of the matrix where `matrix[i][j] == 0` and flips it to 1.
All indices `(i, j)` where `matrix[i][j] == 0` are equally likely to be returned by the `flip` method.
The `reset` method resets all the values of the matrix to be 0.
