The input integer `n` is a positive integer.
The input 2D integer array `edges` is not null.
The length of `edges` is greater than or equal to 1.
Each element `edges[i]` in `edges` is a 2-element array.
Each element `edges[i]` in `edges` contains two positive integers `a` and `b`.
The positive integers `a` and `b` in each element `edges[i]` are not equal.
The positive integers `a` and `b` in each element `edges[i]` are less than or equal to `n`.
There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.
