The method should return an array `ans` containing two elements: `kelvin` and `fahrenheit`.
The value of `kelvin` should be equal to `celsius + 273.15`.
The value of `fahrenheit` should be equal to `celsius * 1.80 + 32.00`.
The values of `kelvin` and `fahrenheit` in the `ans` array should be rounded to five decimal places.
The method should return `ans` with answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer.
