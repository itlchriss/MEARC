The method returns an integer representing the least number of moves required to solve the board.
If it is impossible to solve the board, the method returns -1.
Additional Preconditions:
The `board` parameter contains only unique values between 0 and 5.
The `y` parameter is a valid row index within the dimensions of the `board`.
The `x` parameter is a valid column index within the dimensions of the `board`.
The empty square represented by 0 is adjacent to a number in the 4-directions (up, down, left, right).
Swapping the empty square with an adjacent number results in a valid board configuration.
