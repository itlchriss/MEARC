Preconditions:
- The values of `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty` are integers.
- The values of `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty` are greater than or equal to 1.
- The values of `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty` are less than or equal to 10^9.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations.
- If it is possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations, the method returns `true`.
- If it is not possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations, the method returns `false`.
