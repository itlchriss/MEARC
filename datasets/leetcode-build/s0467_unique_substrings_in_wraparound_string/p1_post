The method returns an integer representing the number of unique non-empty substrings of `p` that are present in the infinite wraparound string `s`.
The method correctly counts the number of unique non-empty substrings of `p` that are present in `s`.
The method handles the case when `p` contains only one character and returns 1 if that character is present in `s`.
The method handles the case when `p` contains multiple characters and returns the correct count of unique non-empty substrings present in `s`.
The method handles the case when `p` contains repeated characters and counts each unique non-empty substring only once.
The method handles the case when `p` contains characters that are not consecutive in the alphabet and counts each unique non-empty substring correctly.
The method handles the case when `p` contains characters that are consecutive in the alphabet and counts each unique non-empty substring correctly.
The method handles the case when `p` contains characters that are consecutive in the alphabet but not in the correct order and counts each unique non-empty substring correctly.
