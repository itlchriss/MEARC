Preconditions:
- The `timeSeries` array is not null.
- The `timeSeries` array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The `duration` is a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.
- The total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned is equal to the sum of the durations of all poison effects.
- If the `timeSeries` array is empty, the method returns 0.
- If the `timeSeries` array has only one element, the method returns the value of `duration`.
- If the `timeSeries` array has multiple elements, the method calculates the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned by iterating through the array and considering the poison effects of each attack.
