The method returns an integer representing the maximum possible score.
The maximum possible score is the maximum of the sum of `nums1` and the sum of `nums2`.
The maximum possible score is achieved by either not swapping any subarray or by swapping a subarray between indices `left` and `right` in both `nums1` and `nums2`.
The subarray to be swapped must be a contiguous sequence of elements within `nums1` and `nums2`.
The indices `left` and `right` must be between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive).
The indices `left` and `right` must satisfy the condition `0 <= left <= right < n`.
