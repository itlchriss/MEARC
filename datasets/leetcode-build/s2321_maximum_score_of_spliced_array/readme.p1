Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are not null.
- The lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` are equal.
- The length `n` of `nums1` and `nums2` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are integers.
- The elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum possible score.
- The maximum possible score is the maximum of the sum of `nums1` and the sum of `nums2`.
- The maximum possible score is achieved by either not swapping any subarray or by swapping a subarray between indices `left` and `right` in both `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The subarray to be swapped must be a contiguous sequence of elements within `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The indices `left` and `right` must be between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive).
- The indices `left` and `right` must satisfy the condition `0 <= left <= right < n`.
