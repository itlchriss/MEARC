- The values in the `parents` array range from 0 to the length of the `parents` array minus - The root node is denoted by -1 in the `parents` array.
- The length of the `queries` array is at least - The length of the `queries` array is at most 3 * 10^- The values in the `queries` array are arrays of length - The first element in each query array is an integer.
- The first element in each query array ranges from 0 to the length of the `parents` array minus - The second element in each query array is an integer.
