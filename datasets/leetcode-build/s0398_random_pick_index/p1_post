The object of the `Solution` class is initialized with the input array `nums`.
The `pick` method returns an integer representing the index of a randomly chosen element from the input array `nums` where the element is equal to the target number `target`.
If there are multiple valid indices, each index should have an equal probability of being returned by the `pick` method.
