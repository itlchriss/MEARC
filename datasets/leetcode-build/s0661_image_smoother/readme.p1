Preconditions:
- The input matrix `img` is not null.
- The dimensions of the input matrix `img` are valid (1 <= m, n <= 200).
- The values in the input matrix `img` are valid (0 <= img[i][j] <= 255).

Postconditions:
- The output matrix `result` is not null.
- The dimensions of the output matrix `result` are the same as the input matrix `img`.
- The values in the output matrix `result` are calculated by rounding down the average of each cell and its eight surrounding cells.
- If one or more of the surrounding cells of a cell is not present, it is not considered in the average calculation.
