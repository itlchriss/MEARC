Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The value of `k` is between 1 and the length of `nums`, inclusive.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are integers.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are between -10^4 and 10^4, inclusive.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned integer value is the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of the input array `nums` that satisfies the given condition.
- For every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied.
