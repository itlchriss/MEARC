The method returns an integer value.
The returned integer value is the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of the input array `nums` that satisfies the given condition.
For every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied.
