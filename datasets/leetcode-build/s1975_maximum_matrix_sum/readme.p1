Preconditions:
1. The input matrix must be a square matrix, i.e., the number of rows must be equal to the number of columns.
2. The size of the matrix must be at least 2x2.
3. The elements of the matrix must be integers.
4. The range of the elements in the matrix is between -10^5 and 10^5.

Postconditions:
1. The method should return a long value representing the maximum sum of the matrix's elements.
2. The matrix's elements should be modified in such a way that the maximum sum is achieved.
3. The modification of the matrix's elements should be done by multiplying any two adjacent elements by -1.
4. The adjacent elements are defined as elements that share a border, i.e., they are either in the same row or in the same column.
