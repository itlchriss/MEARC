Preconditions:
- The input `graph` is a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`.
- The input `graph` represents a network of `n` nodes, where the `i-th` node is directly connected to the `j-th` node if `graph[i][j] == 1`.
- The input `initial` is a non-empty array representing the initially infected nodes.
- The integers in the `initial` array are unique and within the range of `0` to `n-1`.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the node that, if removed, would minimize the number of nodes infected with malware (`M(initial)`).
- If there are multiple nodes that could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, the output is the node with the smallest index.
