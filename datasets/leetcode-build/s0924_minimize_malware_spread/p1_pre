The input `graph` is a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`.
The input `graph` represents a network of `n` nodes, where the `i-th` node is directly connected to the `j-th` node if `graph[i][j] == 1`.
The input `initial` is a non-empty array representing the initially infected nodes.
The integers in the `initial` array are unique and within the range of `0` to `n-1`.
