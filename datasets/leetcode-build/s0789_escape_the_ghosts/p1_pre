The input `ghosts` is a 2D array of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 100`.
Each element in `ghosts` is a 2-element array representing the starting position of a ghost.
The starting positions of the ghosts are given as integral coordinates.
The input `target` is a 2-element array representing the destination point.
The destination point is given as integral coordinates.
The ghosts and the target are located on an infinite 2D grid.
Each turn, the player and all the ghosts can independently choose to move 1 unit in any of the four cardinal directions or stay still.
All actions happen simultaneously.
