The method returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to escape regardless of how the ghosts move.
If it is possible to reach the target before any ghost reaches the player, the method returns `true`.
If the player reaches any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.
If it is not possible to reach the target before any ghost reaches the player, the method returns `false`.
