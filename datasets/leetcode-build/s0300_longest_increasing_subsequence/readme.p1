2. The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
3. The elements in the input array `nums` are integers.
4. The length of the input array `nums` is less than or equal to 2500.
5. The elements in the input array `nums` are within the range of -10^4 to 10^4.

Postconditions:
1. The output is an integer representing the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
2. The output is greater than or equal to 1.
3. The output is less than or equal to the length of the input array `nums`.
4. The output is obtained by deleting some or no elements from the input array `nums` without changing the order of the remaining elements.
5. The output is obtained by selecting a subsequence from the input array `nums` such that the selected subsequence is strictly increasing.
6. The output is obtained by selecting a subsequence from the input array `nums` such that the length of the selected subsequence is maximum.
