The length of the output array `answer` is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
Each element `answer[i]` in the output array represents the distance from index `i` to the closest occurrence of character `c` in `s`.
The distance between two indices `i` and `j` is calculated using the absolute value function `abs(i - j)`.
