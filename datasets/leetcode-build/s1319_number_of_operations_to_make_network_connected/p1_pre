The total number of computers, `totalNumberOfComputers`, is a positive integer.
The `connections` array is not null.
The `connections` array has a length greater than or equal to 1.
Each element in the `connections` array is an array of length 2.
The first element of each connection, `connections[i][0]`, is a valid computer number (between 0 and `totalNumberOfComputers - 1`).
The second element of each connection, `connections[i][1]`, is a valid computer number (between 0 and `totalNumberOfComputers - 1`).
The first and second elements of each connection, `connections[i][0]` and `connections[i][1]`, are not equal.
There are no repeated connections.
No two computers are connected by more than one cable.
