Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than 0.

Postconditions:
- The output array `ans` is not null.
- The length of the output array `ans` is equal to twice the length of the input array `nums`.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the value at index `i` in the output array `ans` is equal to the value at index `i` in the input array `nums`.
- For each index `i` from `n` to `2n-1`, the value at index `i` in the output array `ans` is equal to the value at index `i-n` in the input array `nums`.
