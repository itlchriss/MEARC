Preconditions:
- The input arrays `arr1` and `arr2` are not null.
- The length of `arr1` and `arr2` is between 1 and - The elements in `arr1` and `arr2` are integers between -1000 and - The value of `d` is between 0 and 
Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the distance value between `arr1` and `arr2`.
- The distance value is the number of elements in `arr1` such that there is no element in `arr2` that satisfies the condition `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]| <= d`.
