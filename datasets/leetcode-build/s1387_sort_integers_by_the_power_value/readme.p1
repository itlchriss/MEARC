Preconditions:
- The input integers `lo` and `hi` are within the range of 1 to 1000.
- The input integer `k` is within the range of 1 to `hi - lo + 1`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned integer is within the range of `lo` to `hi`.
- The returned integer is the `k`th integer in the range `[lo, hi]` when sorted by the power value.
- The power value of each integer in the range `[lo, hi]` is calculated correctly.
- The integers in the range `[lo, hi]` are sorted by the power value in ascending order.
- If two or more integers have the same power value, they are sorted by ascending order.
- The power value of each integer in the range `[lo, hi]` fits in a 32-bit signed integer.
