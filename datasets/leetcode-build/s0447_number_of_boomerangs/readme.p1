Preconditions:
- The input `points` is a 2D array of integers.
- The length of `points` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 500.
- Each element in `points` is a 2-element array representing the coordinates of a point.
- The x and y coordinates of each point are integers between -10^4 and 10^4.
- All points in `points` are distinct.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of boomerangs.
- A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) where the distance between i and j is equal to the distance between i and k.
- The order of the points in the tuple matters.
- The method correctly counts the number of boomerangs in the given set of points.
- If there are no boomerangs in the given set of points, the method returns 0.
