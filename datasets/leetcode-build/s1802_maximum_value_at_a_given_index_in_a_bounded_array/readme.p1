Preconditions:
- The input integers `n`, `index`, and `maxSum` are positive.
- The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `index` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`.
- The value of `maxSum` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Postconditions:
- The returned value is an integer.
- The returned value is the value of `nums[index]` in the constructed array.
- The length of the constructed array `nums` is equal to `n`.
- Each element `nums[i]` in the constructed array is a positive integer, where `0 <= i < n`.
- The absolute difference between each adjacent pair of elements in the constructed array is less than or equal to 1.
- The sum of all the elements in the constructed array does not exceed `maxSum`.
