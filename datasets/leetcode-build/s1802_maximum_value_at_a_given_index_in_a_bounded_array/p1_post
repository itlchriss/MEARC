The returned value is an integer.
The returned value is the value of `nums[index]` in the constructed array.
The length of the constructed array `nums` is equal to `n`.
Each element `nums[i]` in the constructed array is a positive integer, where `0 <= i < n`.
The absolute difference between each adjacent pair of elements in the constructed array is less than or equal to 1.
The sum of all the elements in the constructed array does not exceed `maxSum`.
