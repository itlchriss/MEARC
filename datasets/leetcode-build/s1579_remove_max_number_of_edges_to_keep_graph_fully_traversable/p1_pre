The input `n` represents the number of nodes in the graph.
The input `edges` is a 2D array where each element `edges[i]` represents a bidirectional edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` of type `type_i`.
The graph is undirected.
The types of edges are represented by integers: 1 for edges that can be traversed by Alice only, 2 for edges that can be traversed by Bob only, and 3 for edges that can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.
The tuples `(type_i, u_i, v_i)` in `edges` are distinct.
