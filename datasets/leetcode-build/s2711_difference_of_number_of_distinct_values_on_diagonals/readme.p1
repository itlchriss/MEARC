Preconditions:
- The input grid is a 2D array of size m x n.
- The grid is 0-indexed.
- The values in the grid are integers.
- The values in the grid are between 1 and 50 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The output is a matrix answer of size m x n.
- The value of each cell (r, c) in the answer matrix is calculated based on the top-left and bottom-right diagonals of the corresponding cell in the input grid.
- The value of each cell (r, c) in the answer matrix is the absolute difference between the number of distinct values in the top-left diagonal and the number of distinct values in the bottom-right diagonal of the corresponding cell in the input grid.
