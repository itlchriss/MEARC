The output is a matrix answer of size m x n.
The value of each cell (r, c) in the answer matrix is calculated based on the top-left and bottom-right diagonals of the corresponding cell in the input grid.
The value of each cell (r, c) in the answer matrix is the absolute difference between the number of distinct values in the top-left diagonal and the number of distinct values in the bottom-right diagonal of the corresponding cell in the input grid.
