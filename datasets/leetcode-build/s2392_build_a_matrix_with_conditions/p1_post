The method returns a 2D integer array of size `k x k`.
The matrix contains each number from 1 to `k` exactly once.
The remaining cells in the matrix have the value - The number above in each row condition appears in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number below appears.
The number left in each column condition appears in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number right appears.
If no matrix satisfies the conditions, the method returns an empty matrix.
