Preconditions:
- The input integer `k` is a positive integer.
- The input arrays `rowConditions` and `colConditions` have a size of `n` and `m` respectively.
- Each element in the `rowConditions` array is an array of size 2, where the first element represents the number above and the second element represents the number below.
- Each element in the `colConditions` array is an array of size 2, where the first element represents the number left and the second element represents the number right.
- The integers in the `rowConditions` and `colConditions` arrays are between 1 and `k`, inclusive.
- The number above and the number below in each row condition are not equal.
- The number left and the number right in each column condition are not equal.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a 2D integer array of size `k x k`.
- The matrix contains each number from 1 to `k` exactly once.
- The remaining cells in the matrix have the value - The number above in each row condition appears in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number below appears.
- The number left in each column condition appears in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number right appears.
- If no matrix satisfies the conditions, the method returns an empty matrix.
