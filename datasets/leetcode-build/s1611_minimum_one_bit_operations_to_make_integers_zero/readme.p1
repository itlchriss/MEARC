Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations required to transform `n` into 0.
- The binary representation of `n` is modified according to the operations described.
- The rightmost bit of the binary representation of `n` is changed to 0.
- If the `(i-1)`th bit of the binary representation of `n` is 1 and the `(i-2)`th through 0th bits are 0, then the `i`th bit is changed to 0.
