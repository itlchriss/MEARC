Preconditions:
- The input string `s` is not null.
- The length of the input string `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The characters in the input string `s` are either '0' or '1'.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the longest contiguous segment of '1's is strictly longer than the longest contiguous segment of '0's in the input string `s`.
- If there are no '0's in the input string `s`, the longest contiguous segment of '0's is considered to have a length of 0.
- If there are no '1's in the input string `s`, the longest contiguous segment of '1's is considered to have a length of 0.
