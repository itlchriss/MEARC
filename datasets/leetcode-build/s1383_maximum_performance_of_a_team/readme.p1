Preconditions:
- The input arrays `speed` and `efficiency` must have the same length as `n`.
- The length of the input arrays `speed` and `efficiency` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- The values of `k` and `n` must be within the specified constraints.
- The values in the input arrays `speed` and `efficiency` must be within the specified constraints.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer value representing the maximum performance of the team.
- The returned value should be the sum of the speeds of the selected engineers multiplied by the minimum efficiency among them.
- The returned value should be modulo `10^9 + 7`.
