Preconditions:
1. The input strings `s` and `t` are not null.
2. The lengths of `s` and `t` are greater than or equal to 1.
3. The characters in `s` and `t` are all uppercase or lowercase English letters.

Postconditions:
1. The returned string is a substring of `s`.
2. The returned string contains all the characters from `t`, including duplicates.
3. If there is no substring of `s` that contains all the characters from `t`, the returned string is empty ("").
4. The returned string is the minimum window substring, meaning it is the smallest possible substring of `s` that satisfies the previous conditions.
