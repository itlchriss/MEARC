The returned array `answer` is not null.
The length of `answer` is equal to the length of `queries`.
Each element in `answer` is an integer.
If all elements in `nums` are larger than `m_i` for a query `queries[i]`, then `answer[i]` is -1.
Otherwise, `answer[i]` is the maximum bitwise XOR value of `x_i` and any element of `nums` that does not exceed `m_i`.
