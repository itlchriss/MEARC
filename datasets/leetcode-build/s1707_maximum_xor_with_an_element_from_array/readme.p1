Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums` and `queries` are not null.
- The length of `nums` and `queries` is greater than or equal to 1.
- Each element in `nums` is a non-negative integer.
- Each element in `queries` is an array of length 2.
- The first element of each array in `queries` is a non-negative integer.
- The second element of each array in `queries` is a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
- The returned array `answer` is not null.
- The length of `answer` is equal to the length of `queries`.
- Each element in `answer` is an integer.
- If all elements in `nums` are larger than `m_i` for a query `queries[i]`, then `answer[i]` is -1.
- Otherwise, `answer[i]` is the maximum bitwise XOR value of `x_i` and any element of `nums` that does not exceed `m_i`.
