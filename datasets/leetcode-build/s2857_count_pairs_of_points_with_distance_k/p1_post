The return value is an integer representing the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and the distance between points `i` and `j` is equal to `k`.
The return value is non-negative.
The return value is less than or equal to the total number of valid pairs that satisfy the given conditions.
The return value is equal to 0 if there are no valid pairs that satisfy the given conditions.
The return value is equal to 1 if there is exactly one valid pair that satisfies the given conditions.
The return value is equal to the total number of valid pairs that satisfy the given conditions if all pairs are valid.
The order of the pairs in the return value does not matter.
The input `c` is not modified by the method.
