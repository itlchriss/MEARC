Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer.
- The input `mines` is a non-empty array of arrays, where each inner array contains two integers `x` and `y`.
- The values of `x` and `y` in each inner array are non-negative integers less than `n`.
- The pairs `(x, y)` in `mines` are unique.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the order of the largest axis-aligned plus sign of 1's contained in `grid`.
- If there is no plus sign, the output is 0.
