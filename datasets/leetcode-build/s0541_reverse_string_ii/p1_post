The output string is not null.
The length of the output string is the same as the length of the input string `s`.
The characters in the output string are reversed in groups of `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.
If there are fewer than `k` characters left, all of them are reversed.
If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, the first `k` characters are reversed and the remaining characters are left unchanged.
