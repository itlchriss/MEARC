The output is a 2D array of integers representing the coordinates of all cells in the matrix.
The output array is sorted by the distance of each cell from the center cell `(rCenter, cCenter)`.
The distance between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is calculated as `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.
The output array contains all cells in the matrix.
The output array may be in any order as long as it satisfies the condition of being sorted by distance from the center cell.
