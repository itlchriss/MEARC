Preconditions:
- The input integers `rows` and `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The input integers `rCenter` and `cCenter` must be within the range of the matrix dimensions (`rows` and `cols` respectively).

Postconditions:
- The output is a 2D array of integers representing the coordinates of all cells in the matrix.
- The output array is sorted by the distance of each cell from the center cell `(rCenter, cCenter)`.
- The distance between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is calculated as `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.
- The output array contains all cells in the matrix.
- The output array may be in any order as long as it satisfies the condition of being sorted by distance from the center cell.
