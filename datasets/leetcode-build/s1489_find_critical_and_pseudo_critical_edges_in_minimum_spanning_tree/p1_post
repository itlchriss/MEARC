The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a set of critical or pseudo-critical edges.
The first list in the output should contain the indices of all critical edges in the minimum spanning tree.
The second list in the output should contain the indices of all pseudo-critical edges in the minimum spanning tree.
A critical edge is an edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the weight of the minimum spanning tree to increase.
A pseudo-critical edge is an edge that can appear in some minimum spanning trees but not all.
The indices of the edges in the output should correspond to the indices of the edges in the input array.
