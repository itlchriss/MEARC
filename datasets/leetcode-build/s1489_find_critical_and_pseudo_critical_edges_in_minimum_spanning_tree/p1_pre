The input graph must be a weighted undirected connected graph.
The number of vertices in the graph must be between 2 and The number of edges in the graph must be between 1 and the minimum of 200 and n * (n - 1) / Each edge in the input array must be represented as [a, b, weight], where a and b are distinct vertices in the graph and weight is a positive integer between 1 and The indices of the edges in the output can be in any order.
