Preconditions:
- The length of `nums1` and `nums2` must be equal.
- The length of `nums1` and `nums2` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- The elements of `nums1` and `nums2` must be non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum possible score.
- The maximum possible score is calculated by choosing a subsequence of indices from `nums1` of length `k` and calculating the score using the given formula.
- The maximum possible score is the highest score among all possible subsequences.
