Preconditions:
1. The input grid must be a 2D integer matrix.
2. The input moveCost must be a 2D integer matrix.
3. The dimensions of the input grid and moveCost must be consistent.
4. The input grid must have distinct integers from 0 to m * n - 1.
5. The input moveCost must have a size of (m * n) x n.
6. The values in the input moveCost must be positive integers.

Postconditions:
1. The method returns an integer representing the minimum cost of a path.
2. The minimum cost of a path is the sum of the values of cells visited plus the sum of costs of all the moves made.
3. The path starts from any cell in the first row and ends at any cell in the last row.
4. The method ignores the cost of moving from cells in the last row of the grid.
5. The method returns the minimum cost of a path that satisfies the given conditions.
