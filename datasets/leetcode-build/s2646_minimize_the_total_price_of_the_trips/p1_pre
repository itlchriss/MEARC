The input integer `n` represents the number of nodes in the tree.
The input 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` represents the edges in the tree.
Each element `edges[i]` in `edges` is a 2-element array `[a, b]` where `a` and `b` are node indices indicating an edge between nodes `a` and `b`.
The input integer array `price` of length `n` represents the prices of each node.
Each element `price[i]` in `price` is the price of the `i`-th node.
The input 2D integer array `trips` represents the trips to be performed.
Each element `trips[i]` in `trips` is a 2-element array `[start, end]` where `start` and `end` are node indices indicating a trip from node `start` to node `end`.
The prices in `price` are even integers.
The number of trips in `trips` is between 1 and 100.
The node indices in `edges` and `trips` are between 0 and `n - 1`.
