The method returns an integer representing the number of different non-empty subsets with the maximum bitwise OR.
The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is calculated correctly.
The method handles the case where there are multiple subsets with the maximum bitwise OR.
The method handles the case where all non-empty subsets have the same bitwise OR.
The method handles the case where the input array contains duplicate elements.
The method handles the case where the input array contains duplicate elements and the maximum bitwise OR is the same for all subsets.
