Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 2.
- Each element in `nums` must be an integer between 1 and 100.
- The input array `queries` must have a length greater than or equal to 1.
- Each element in `queries` must be a subarray of `nums` defined by two indices `l` and `r`, where `0 <= l < r < nums.length`.

Postconditions:
- The output array `ans` must have a length equal to the length of `queries`.
- Each element in `ans` must be an integer representing the minimum absolute difference of the corresponding subarray in `queries`.
- If all elements in a subarray are the same, the corresponding element in `ans` must be -1.
