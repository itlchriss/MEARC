Preconditions:
- The input `neededApples` is a positive integer.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long value representing the minimum perimeter of a plot such that at least `neededApples` apples are inside or on the perimeter of that plot.
- The returned perimeter is the minimum possible value.
- The returned perimeter is calculated based on the number of apples inside or on the perimeter of the plot.
- The plot is an axis-aligned square plot of land centered at `(0, 0)`.
- The plot contains at least `neededApples` apples.
- The plot may contain more than `neededApples` apples.
- The perimeter is calculated as the sum of the lengths of all sides of the plot multiplied by 4.
- The length of each side of the plot is an even number.
- The plot is a square, meaning all sides have the same length.
- The plot is centered at `(0, 0)`, meaning the coordinates `(0, 0)` are at the center of the plot.
- The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate `(i, j)` has `|i| + |j|` apples growing on it.
- The value of `|x|` is defined as `x` if `x >= 0` and `-x` if `x < 0`.
- The minimum perimeter is calculated by increasing the side length of the plot until the number of apples inside or on the perimeter is at least `neededApples`.
