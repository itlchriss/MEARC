The output array `arr` is not null.
The length of `arr` is equal to `n`.
The elements of `arr` are non-negative integers.
The first element of `arr` is equal to the input integer `first`.
For each index `i` from 0 to `n - 2`, the element at index `i + 1` of `arr` is equal to the XOR of the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` of `encoded`.
