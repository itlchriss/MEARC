Preconditions:
- The input array `encoded` is not null.
- The length of `encoded` is equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the original array `arr`.
- The elements of `encoded` are non-negative integers.
- The input integer `first` is not null.
- The value of `first` is a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
- The output array `arr` is not null.
- The length of `arr` is equal to `n`.
- The elements of `arr` are non-negative integers.
- The first element of `arr` is equal to the input integer `first`.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n - 2`, the element at index `i + 1` of `arr` is equal to the XOR of the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` of `encoded`.
