The output array `ans` must be a 2D integer array.
The length of `ans` must be equal to the length of `queries`.
Each element in `ans` must be an array of length 2.
The first element of each element in `ans` must be an integer representing the left endpoint of the substring.
The second element of each element in `ans` must be an integer representing the right endpoint of the substring.
If there is no substring that satisfies the condition, the corresponding element in `ans` must be [-1, -1].
If there are multiple substrings that satisfy the condition, the corresponding element in `ans` must be the one with the minimum left endpoint.
