Preconditions:
- The input string `s` must be a binary string.
- The length of `s` must be between 1 and 10^4.
- Each character in `s` must be either '0' or '1'.
- The input array `queries` must be a 2D integer array.
- The length of `queries` must be between 1 and 10^5.
- Each element in `queries` must be an array of length 2.
- The first element of each query must be a non-negative integer.
- The second element of each query must be a non-negative integer.
- The first element of each query must be less than or equal to 10^9.
- The second element of each query must be less than or equal to 10^9.

Postconditions:
- The output array `ans` must be a 2D integer array.
- The length of `ans` must be equal to the length of `queries`.
- Each element in `ans` must be an array of length 2.
- The first element of each element in `ans` must be an integer representing the left endpoint of the substring.
- The second element of each element in `ans` must be an integer representing the right endpoint of the substring.
- If there is no substring that satisfies the condition, the corresponding element in `ans` must be [-1, -1].
- If there are multiple substrings that satisfy the condition, the corresponding element in `ans` must be the one with the minimum left endpoint.
