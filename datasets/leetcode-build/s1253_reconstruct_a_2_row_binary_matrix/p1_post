The returned matrix is a 2-D integer array.
The sum of elements in the upper row of the returned matrix is equal to `upper`.
The sum of elements in the lower row of the returned matrix is equal to `lower`.
The sum of elements in each column of the returned matrix is equal to the corresponding element in `colsum`.
If there are multiple valid solutions, any of them can be returned.
If no valid solution exists, an empty 2-D array is returned.
