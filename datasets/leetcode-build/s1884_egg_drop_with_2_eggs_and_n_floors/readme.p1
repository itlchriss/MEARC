Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the minimum number of moves needed to determine the value of `f`.
- The value of `f` is an integer between 0 and `n`.
- The first egg is dropped from floor 1 and the second egg is dropped from floor 2.
- If the first egg breaks, the value of `f` is 0.
- If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, the value of `f` is 1.
- If both eggs survive, the value of `f` is 2.
- If the first egg does not break, it is dropped again at floor 22.
- If the first egg does not break again, it is dropped from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.
- Regardless of the outcome, it takes at most 14 drops to determine the value of `f`.
