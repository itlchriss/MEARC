The input array `nums` has a length of `n`.
All elements in the array `nums` are initially uncolored and have a value of 0.
The input 2D array `queries` has a length of `m`.
Each query in `queries` is represented by a 2-element array `[index, color]`.
The index `index` in each query is a valid index in the array `nums` (0 <= index < n).
The color `color` in each query is a valid color (1 <= color <= 10^5).
