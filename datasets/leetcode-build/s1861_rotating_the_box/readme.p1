Preconditions:
- The input `box` is a 2D character array.
- The dimensions of `box` are `m x n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- Each cell of `box` contains one of the following characters: `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.
- Each stone in `box` rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a new `n x m` matrix representing the box after the rotation described above.
- The dimensions of the returned matrix are `n x m`, where `n` is the number of columns and `m` is the number of rows.
- The cells of the returned matrix contain the same characters as the corresponding cells in the input `box`, but rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
- The stones in the returned matrix fall down until they land on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.
- The obstacles' positions remain unchanged.
- The stones' horizontal positions remain unchanged.
