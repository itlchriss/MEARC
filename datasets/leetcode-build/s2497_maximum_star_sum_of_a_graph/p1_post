The method returns an integer representing the maximum star sum of a star graph containing at most `k` edges.
The returned maximum star sum is the sum of the values of all the nodes present in the star graph.
The returned maximum star sum is the maximum possible sum among all star graphs with at most `k` edges.
If there are no edges in the graph (i.e., `edges` is an empty array), the method returns the value of the center node (i.e., `vals[0]`).
If `k` is equal to 0, the method returns the value of the center node (i.e., `vals[0]`).
If `k` is equal to the number of edges in the graph, the method returns the sum of the values of all nodes in the graph (i.e., the sum of all elements in `nodeValues`).
The method does not modify the input arrays `nodeValues` and `edges`.
