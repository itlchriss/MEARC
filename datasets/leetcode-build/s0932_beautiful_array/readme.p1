Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer.
- The input `n` is within the range of 1 to 1000.

Postconditions:
- The output `nums` is an array of length `n`.
- The elements in `nums` are a permutation of the integers in the range `[1, n]`.
- For every `0 <= i < j < n`, there is no index `k` with `i < k < j` where `2 * nums[k] == nums[i] + nums[j]`.
