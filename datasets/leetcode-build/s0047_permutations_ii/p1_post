The method returns a list of lists of integers.
Each list in the returned list represents a unique permutation of the input array `nums`.
The order of the permutations in the returned list can be in any order.
The length of each permutation in the returned list is equal to the length of the input array `nums`.
The elements in each permutation in the returned list are in the same order as the input array `nums`.
The returned list does not contain any duplicate permutations.
