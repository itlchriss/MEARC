The method returns a double value representing the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity of the method is O(log (m+n)).
The merged array of `nums1` and `nums2` is sorted in ascending order.
If the merged array has an odd length, the median is the middle element of the array.
If the merged array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the array.
