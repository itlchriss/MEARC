Preconditions:
The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in ascending order.
The lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` are not negative.
The sum of the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` is not greater than The values in `nums1` and `nums2` are within the range of -10^6 to 10^
Postconditions:
The method returns a double value representing the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity of the method is O(log (m+n)).
The merged array of `nums1` and `nums2` is sorted in ascending order.
If the merged array has an odd length, the median is the middle element of the array.
If the merged array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the array.
