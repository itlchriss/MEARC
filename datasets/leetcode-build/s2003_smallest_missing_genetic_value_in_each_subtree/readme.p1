Preconditions:
- The length of `parents` and `nums` arrays is the same.
- The length of the `parents` array is at least 2.
- The value of `parents[0]` is -1.
- The values in the `parents` array are within the range of 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the `parents` array.
- The values in the `nums` array are distinct.
- Each value in the `nums` array is within the range of 1 to 10^5.

Postconditions:
