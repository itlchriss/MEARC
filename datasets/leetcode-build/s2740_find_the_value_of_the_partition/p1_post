The output is an integer representing the value of the partition.
The value of the partition is minimized.
The partition divides the input array `nums` into two non-empty arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
Each element of the input array `nums` belongs to either `nums1` or `nums2`.
The maximum element of `nums1` is equal to the maximum element of `nums1`.
The minimum element of `nums2` is equal to the minimum element of `nums2`.
