The method returns a list of integers.
The list of integers represents a Fibonacci-like sequence.
Each integer in the list is non-negative and fits in a 32-bit signed integer type.
The length of the list is at least 3.
The sum of any two consecutive integers in the list is equal to the next integer in the list.
The list is a valid split of the input string `num`.
If a valid split is not possible, an empty list is returned.
