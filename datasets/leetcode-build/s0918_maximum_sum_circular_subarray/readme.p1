Preconditions:
1. The input array `nums` is not null.
2. The length of the input array `nums` is greater than 0.
3. The length of the input array `nums` is less than or equal to 30,000.
4. Each element in the input array `nums` is an integer.
5. Each element in the input array `nums` is within the range of -30,000 to 30,000.

Postconditions:
1. The method returns an integer representing the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray of `nums`.
2. The subarray included in the maximum sum does not contain any repeated elements.
3. The subarray can be circular, meaning the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array.
4. The next element of `nums[i]` is `nums[(i + 1) % n]` and the previous element of `nums[i]` is `nums[(i - 1 + n) % n]`.
5. If all elements in the input array `nums` are negative, the method returns the maximum negative value in the array.
6. If all elements in the input array `nums` are positive, the method returns the sum of all elements in the array.
7. If the maximum sum of a non-empty subarray is achieved by wrapping around the circular array, the method returns the maximum sum.
8. If the maximum sum of a non-empty subarray is achieved without wrapping around the circular array, the method returns the maximum sum.
