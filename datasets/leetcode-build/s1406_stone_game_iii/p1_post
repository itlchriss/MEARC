The output is a string.
The output is either "Alice", "Bob", or "Tie".
If the output is "Alice", it means Alice will win the game.
If the output is "Bob", it means Bob will win the game.
If the output is "Tie", it means the game will end with the same score for both players.
The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken.
The score of each player is initially 0.
Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
Alice and Bob play optimally.
