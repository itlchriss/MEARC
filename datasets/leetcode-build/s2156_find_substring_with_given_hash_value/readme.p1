Preconditions:
- The input string `s` is not null.
- The length of `s` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The values of `power`, `modulo`, and `k` are positive integers.
- The value of `hashValue` is between 0 and `modulo` (exclusive).

Postconditions:
- The method returns a substring `sub` of `s` with length `k`.
- The hash value of `sub` computed using the given formula is equal to `hashValue`.
- `sub` is the first substring of length `k` in `s` that has a hash value equal to `hashValue`.
