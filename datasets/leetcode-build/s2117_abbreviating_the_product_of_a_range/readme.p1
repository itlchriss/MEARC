Preconditions:
- The input integers `left` and `right` must be positive.
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

Postconditions:
- The output string must represent the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range `[left, right]`.
- The output string must be in the format `"<pre>...<suf>eC"`, where `<pre>` denotes the first 5 digits of the product, `<suf>` denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing trailing zeros, and `C` denotes the count of trailing zeros.
- If there are no trailing zeros in the product, the output string must not contain the `eC` part.
- If the number of digits in the product is less than or equal to 10, the output string must not be further abbreviated.
- If the number of digits in the product is greater than 10, the output string must be abbreviated by only including the first 5 digits and the last 5 digits after removing trailing zeros.
