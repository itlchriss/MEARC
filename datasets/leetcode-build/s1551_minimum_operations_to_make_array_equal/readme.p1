Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer.
- The array `arr` has a length of `n`.
- The elements of `arr` are calculated using the formula `arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1` for all valid values of `i` (i.e., `0 <= i < n`).

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of `arr` equal.
- All the elements of `arr` are equal.
