Preconditions:
1. The input graph must be a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
2. The graph must have at least 2 nodes.
3. The nodes in the graph must be labeled from 0 to n - 1.
4. The graph must not contain any self-loops (graph[i][j] != i).
5. All elements in each graph[i] list must be unique.

Postconditions:
1. The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a path from node 0 to node n - 1.
2. The order of the paths in the returned list can be arbitrary.
3. Each path in the returned list should be represented as a list of integers.
4. The first element of each path should be 0, and the last element should be n - 1.
5. Each path in the returned list should be a valid path in the input graph, following the directed edges.
6. The returned list should contain all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1.
