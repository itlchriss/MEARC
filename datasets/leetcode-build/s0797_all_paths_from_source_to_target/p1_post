1. The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a path from node 0 to node n - 1.
2. The order of the paths in the returned list can be arbitrary.
3. Each path in the returned list should be represented as a list of integers.
4. The first element of each path should be 0, and the last element should be n - 1.
5. Each path in the returned list should be a valid path in the input graph, following the directed edges.
6. The returned list should contain all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1.
