The method returns a boolean value indicating whether there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.
If there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array that satisfy the conditions, the method returns `true`.
If there are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array that satisfy the conditions, the method returns `false`.
