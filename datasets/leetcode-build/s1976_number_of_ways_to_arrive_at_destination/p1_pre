The input `n` is a positive integer.
The input `roads` is a 2D integer array.
The length of `roads` is less than or equal to `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
Each element `roads[i]` is an array of length 3.
The first element of `roads[i]`, `roads[i][0]`, is an integer between 0 and `n - 1`.
The second element of `roads[i]`, `roads[i][1]`, is an integer between 0 and `n - 1`.
The third element of `roads[i]`, `roads[i][2]`, is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9.
The first and second elements of `roads[i]` are not equal.
There is at most one road connecting any two intersections.
You can reach any intersection from any other intersection.
