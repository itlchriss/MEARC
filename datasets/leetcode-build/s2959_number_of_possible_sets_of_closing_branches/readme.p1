Preconditions:
- The input `n` represents the number of branches in the company and must be a positive integer.
- The input `maxDistance` represents the maximum distance allowed between branches and must be a positive integer.
- The input `roads` is a 2D array representing the roads between branches. It can be empty or contain up to 1000 elements.
- Each element in `roads` is a 3-element array `[u, v, w]` where `u` and `v` are branch indices and `w` is the length of the road between them.
- The branch indices `u` and `v` must be between 0 and `n-1`, inclusive.
- The length `w` of each road must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
- Initially, all branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of possible sets of closing branches.
- After closing a branch, the company will no longer have access to any roads connected to it.
- The remaining branches after closing must have a distance of at most `maxDistance` from each other.
- The method returns the correct number of possible sets of closing branches based on the given inputs.
