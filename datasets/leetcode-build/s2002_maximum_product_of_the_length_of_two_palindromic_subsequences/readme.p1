Preconditions:
- The input string `s` is not null.
- The length of the input string `s` is at least 2 and at most 12.
- The input string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum possible product of the lengths of two palindromic subsequences of the input string `s`.
- The two palindromic subsequences are disjoint, meaning they do not both pick a character at the same index.
- The product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences is maximized.
