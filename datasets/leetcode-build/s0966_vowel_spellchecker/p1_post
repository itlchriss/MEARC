The method returns an array of strings.
The length of the returned array is equal to the length of the queries array.
Each element in the returned array is a correct word for the corresponding query in the queries array.
The returned array follows the precedence rules mentioned in the requirements:
- If the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), the same word is returned.
- If the query matches a word up to capitalization, the first such match in the wordlist is returned.
- If the query matches a word up to vowel errors, the first such match in the wordlist is returned.
- If the query has no matches in the wordlist, an empty string is returned.
