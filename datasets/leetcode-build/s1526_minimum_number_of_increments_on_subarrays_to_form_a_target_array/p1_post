The output is an integer representing the minimum number of operations required to form the `target` array from the `initial` array.
The `initial` array is modified such that it becomes the `target` array after the minimum number of operations.
Each element in the `initial` array is a non-negative integer.
The sum of all elements in the `initial` array is equal to the sum of all elements in the `target` array.
