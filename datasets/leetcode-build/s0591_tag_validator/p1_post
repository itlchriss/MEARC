The method should return a boolean value indicating whether the code is valid or not.
Additional behavioural requirements:
The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag.
A closed tag must have the format `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`.
The start tag and end tag of a closed tag must have the same TAG_NAME.
A valid TAG_NAME must only contain uppercase letters and have a length between 1 and 9.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata, and any characters except unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tags, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa.
A `<` is unmatched if there is no subsequent `>`.
When encountering `<` or `</`, all subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME.
The cdata has the format `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`.
The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`.
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters.
The function of cdata is to forbid the validator from parsing CDATA_CONTENT as tags.
Even if CDATA_CONTENT has characters that can be parsed as tags, they should be treated as regular characters.
