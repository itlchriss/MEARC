The method returns an integer value representing the maximum possible score of a good subarray.
The returned score is greater than or equal to - The returned score is calculated based on the formula `min(nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[j]) * (j - i + 1)`, where `i` and `j` are indices of the subarray and `min(nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[j])` represents the minimum value in the subarray.
