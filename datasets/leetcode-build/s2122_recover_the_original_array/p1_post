The output array `arr` has a length of `n`.
The integers in `arr` are positive.
The sum of the differences between the corresponding elements in `arr` and `lower` is equal to the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements in `higher` and `arr`.
The combination of `lower` and `higher` gives a permutation of `nums`.
If there are multiple valid arrays, any one of them can be returned.
