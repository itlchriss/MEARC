The output is a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays for each group of farmland.
If there are no groups of farmland, the output is an empty array.
The output arrays are in any order.
Each group of farmland is represented by a 4-length array [r1, c1, r2, c2], where (r1, c1) is the top left corner and (r2, c2) is the bottom right corner of the group.
