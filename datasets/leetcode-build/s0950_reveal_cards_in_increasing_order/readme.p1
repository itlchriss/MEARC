Preconditions:
- The input array `deck` is not null.
- The length of `deck` is at least 1 and at most 1000.
- Each element in `deck` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
- All the values in `deck` are unique.

Postconditions:
- The output is an array of integers.
- The length of the output array is the same as the length of the input array.
- The output array contains all the elements from the input array.
- The elements in the output array are in increasing order.
- The first element in the output array is the smallest element from the input array.
- The last element in the output array is the largest element from the input array.
- The order of the elements in the output array is such that it follows the steps described in the problem statement:
  1. Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
  2. If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
  3. If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
