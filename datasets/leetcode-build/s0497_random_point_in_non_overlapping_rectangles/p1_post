The `Solution` object is initialized with the given rectangles.
The `pick` method returns a random integer point `[u, v]` inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles.
The returned point `[u, v]` has integer coordinates.
Any integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles is equally likely to be returned.
The `pick` method can be called multiple times and each time it should return a different random point.
