Preconditions:
- The input array `intervals` is not null.
- The length of the input array `intervals` is greater than or equal to - Each interval in the input array `intervals` is represented by an array of length - The start and end values of each interval in the input array `intervals` are within the range of -5 * 10^4 to 5 * 10^- The start value of each interval in the input array `intervals` is less than the end value.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
