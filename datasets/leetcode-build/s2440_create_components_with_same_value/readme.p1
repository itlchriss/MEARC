Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of `nums` is equal to `n`.
- The input array `edges` is not null.
- The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in `edges` is an array of length 2.
- The values in `edges` are valid node indices (between 0 and `n - 1`).
- The input tree is connected and does not contain any cycles.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the maximum number of edges that can be deleted.
- The input tree is split into multiple connected components.
- Each connected component has the same value, which is the sum of the values in `nums` for the nodes in that component.
