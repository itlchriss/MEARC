Preconditions:
- The input integer `n` is a positive integer.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the smallest value `n` will take on.
- The value of `n` is continuously replaced with the sum of its prime factors until it cannot be further reduced.
- If `n` is already a prime number, the method returns `n` itself.
- The method terminates and returns the smallest value `n` will take on.
