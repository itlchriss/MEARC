Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
- All elements in the input array `nums` are integers.
- All elements in the input array `nums` are between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The returned index `i` is the smallest index in the input array `nums` such that `i mod 10 == nums[i]`.
- If there is no index in the input array `nums` that satisfies the condition `i mod 10 == nums[i]`, then the method returns -1.
