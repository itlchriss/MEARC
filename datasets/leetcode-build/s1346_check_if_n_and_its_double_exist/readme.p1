Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` must not be null.
- The length of the input array `arr` must be at least 2.
- The elements of the input array `arr` must be integers.
- The elements of the input array `arr` must be within the range of -10^3 to 10^3.

Postconditions:
- The method should return a boolean value indicating whether there exist two integers `N` and `M` such that `N` is the double of `M`.
- If there exist two indices `i` and `j` such that `i != j`, `0 <= i, j < arr.length`, and `arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]`, the method should return true.
- If there does not exist two indices `i` and `j` satisfying the above conditions, the method should return false.
