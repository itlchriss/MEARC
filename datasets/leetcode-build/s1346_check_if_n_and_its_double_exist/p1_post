The method should return a boolean value indicating whether there exist two integers `N` and `M` such that `N` is the double of `M`.
If there exist two indices `i` and `j` such that `i != j`, `0 <= i, j < arr.length`, and `arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]`, the method should return true.
If there does not exist two indices `i` and `j` satisfying the above conditions, the method should return false.
