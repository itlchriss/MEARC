The method returns an integer representing the maximum quality of a valid path.
The returned value is non-negative.
The returned value is not greater than the sum of all values in the input array `values`.
The returned value is the sum of the values of the unique nodes visited in the path.
The path starts at node 0 and ends at node 0.
The path takes at most `maxTime` seconds to complete.
The path may visit the same node multiple times.
The path may include cycles.
The path may include any number of nodes.
The path may include any number of edges.
The path may include any combination of edges and nodes.
The path may include any number of unique nodes.
The path may include any number of non-unique nodes.
The path may include any number of edges connected to each node.
The path may include any combination of edges connected to each node.
The path may include any number of edges with different weights.
The path may include any combination of edges with different weights.
The path may include any number of edges with the same weight.
The path may include any combination of edges with the same weight.
The path may include any number of edges with the same starting and ending nodes.
The path may include any combination of edges with the same starting and ending nodes.
The path may include any number of edges with the same starting and ending nodes and different weights.
