The method returns a long integer representing the minimum sum of squared difference after modifying `nums1` at most `k1` times and modifying `nums2` at most `k2` times.
The returned minimum sum of squared difference is calculated as the sum of (nums1[i] - nums2[i])^2 for each index i from 0 to n-1.
The elements of `nums1` and `nums2` may be modified by adding or subtracting 1 at most `k1` and `k2` times respectively.
The modified elements of `nums1` and `nums2` can be negative integers.
