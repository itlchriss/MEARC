Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have the same length `n`.
- The length `n` of the input arrays must be between 1 and 10^5.
- The elements of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be non-negative integers between 0 and 10^5.
- The values of `k1` and `k2` must be non-negative integers between 0 and 10^9.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long integer representing the minimum sum of squared difference after modifying `nums1` at most `k1` times and modifying `nums2` at most `k2` times.
- The returned minimum sum of squared difference is calculated as the sum of (nums1[i] - nums2[i])^2 for each index i from 0 to n-1.
- The elements of `nums1` and `nums2` may be modified by adding or subtracting 1 at most `k1` and `k2` times respectively.
- The modified elements of `nums1` and `nums2` can be negative integers.
