The method returns an integer representing the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated.
The method detonates a single bomb.
When a bomb is detonated, it detonates all bombs that lie within its range.
The detonation of bombs continues recursively, detonating bombs within the range of the initially detonated bombs.
The method considers all possible combinations of detonating a single bomb and calculates the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated.
