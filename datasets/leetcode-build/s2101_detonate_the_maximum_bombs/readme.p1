Preconditions:
- The input `bombs` is a 2D integer array.
- The length of `bombs` is between 1 and 100.
- Each element in `bombs` is an array of length 3.
- The values of `x_i`, `y_i`, and `r_i` in each element of `bombs` are between 1 and 10^5.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated.
- The method detonates a single bomb.
- When a bomb is detonated, it detonates all bombs that lie within its range.
- The detonation of bombs continues recursively, detonating bombs within the range of the initially detonated bombs.
- The method considers all possible combinations of detonating a single bomb and calculates the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated.
