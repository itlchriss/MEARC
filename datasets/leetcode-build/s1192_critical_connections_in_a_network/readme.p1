Preconditions:
- The input `n` is an integer greater than or equal to - The input `connections` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers `a` and `b`, representing a connection between servers `a` and `b`.
- The length of `connections` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
- The integers `a` and `b` in each inner list are between 0 and `n - 1`, inclusive.
- The integers `a` and `b` in each inner list are not equal.
- There are no repeated connections.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers `a` and `b`, representing a critical connection between servers `a` and `b`.
- The returned list contains all critical connections in the network.
- The order of the critical connections in the returned list can be arbitrary.
