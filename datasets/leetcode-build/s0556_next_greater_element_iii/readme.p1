Preconditions:
- The input integer `n` is a positive integer.
- The input integer `n` is within the range of a 32-bit integer (1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1).

Postconditions:
- If there exists a positive integer greater than `n` with the same digits, return the smallest such integer.
- If there is no such positive integer, return -1.
- The returned integer should fit within a 32-bit integer. If it does not, return -1.
