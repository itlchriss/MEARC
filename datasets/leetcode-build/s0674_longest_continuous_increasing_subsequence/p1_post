The returned value is an integer.
The returned value represents the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence in the input array `nums`.
The subsequence must be strictly increasing, meaning that for each `l <= i < r`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.
The subsequence is defined by two indices `l` and `r` (`l < r`) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]`.
The subsequence is continuous, meaning that there are no elements between `nums[l]` and `nums[r]` in the input array `nums`.
If there are multiple longest continuous increasing subsequences with the same length, the method can return the length of any one of them.
