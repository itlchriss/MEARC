Preconditions:
- The input array `heights` is not null.
- The input array `queries` is not null.
- The length of `heights` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The length of `queries` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements in `heights` are positive integers.
- The elements in `queries` are valid indices within the `heights` array.

Postconditions:
- The returned array `ans` is not null.
- The length of `ans` is equal to the length of `queries`.
- The elements in `ans` are either valid indices within the `heights` array or -1.
- For each query `queries[i] = [a, b]`, if `ans[i]` is not -1, then `heights[a] < heights[ans[i]]` and `heights[b] < heights[ans[i]]`.
- For each query `queries[i] = [a, b]`, if `ans[i]` is -1, then there is no index `j` such that `heights[a] < heights[j]` and `heights[b] < heights[j]`.
