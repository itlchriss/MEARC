The output list must contain tokens representing the simplified expression.
Each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient must be written in sorted order lexicographically.
Terms must have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity.
The largest degree terms must be placed first in the output list, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
The leading coefficient of each term must be placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist).
A leading coefficient of 1 must still be printed.
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 must not be included in the output list.
