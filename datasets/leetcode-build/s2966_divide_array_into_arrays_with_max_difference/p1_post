The returned 2D array contains one or more arrays of size 3.
Each element of the input array `nums` is in exactly one array in the returned 2D array.
The difference between any two elements in each array in the returned 2D array is less than or equal to `k`.
If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, the returned 2D array is empty.
If there are multiple valid solutions, any of them can be returned.
