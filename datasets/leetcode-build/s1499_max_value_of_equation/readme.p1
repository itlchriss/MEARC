Preconditions:
- The input array `points` is not null.
- The length of the input array `points` is at least - The elements in the input array `points` are not null.
- The length of each element in the input array `points` is - The value of `k` is non-negative.
- The elements in the input array `points` are sorted in ascending order based on the x-values.
- The x-values in the input array `points` form a strictly increasing sequence.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned value is the maximum value of the equation `y_i + y_j + |x_i - x_j|` where `|x_i - x_j| <= k` and `1 <= i < j <= points.length`.
