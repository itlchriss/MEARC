Preconditions:
- The input integer `n` represents the number of courses, and it must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The input array `relations` represents the prerequisite relationships between courses. Each element `relations[i]` must be an array of length 2, where `relations[i][0]` represents the prerequisite course and `relations[i][1]` represents the course that depends on the prerequisite. The prerequisite course and the dependent course must be integers between 1 and `n`, inclusive.
- The input integer `k` represents the maximum number of courses that can be taken in one semester, and it must be greater than or equal to 1.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses.
- The returned value must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The test cases will be generated such that it is possible to take every course.
