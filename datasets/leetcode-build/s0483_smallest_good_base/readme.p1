Preconditions:
1. The input `n` is a string representation of a positive integer.
2. The input `n` does not contain any leading zeros.

Postconditions:
1. The output is a string representation of the smallest good base of `n`.
2. The output is a positive integer in base `k` where all digits are `1`'s.
3. The output is the smallest possible base `k` that satisfies the condition.
4. The output is a valid base for `n`, meaning that all digits in `n` can be represented in base `k`.
5. The output is a valid base for `n`, meaning that the base `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
