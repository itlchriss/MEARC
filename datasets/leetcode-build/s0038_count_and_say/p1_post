The method returns a string representing the `nth` term of the count-and-say sequence.
The returned string follows the rules of the count-and-say sequence:
- The first term is always "1".
- Each subsequent term is obtained by "saying" the previous term.
- To "say" a term, it is split into groups of contiguous characters that are the same.
- For each group, the number of characters is said, followed by the character itself.
- The saying is then converted into a digit string by replacing the counts with numbers and concatenating every saying.
