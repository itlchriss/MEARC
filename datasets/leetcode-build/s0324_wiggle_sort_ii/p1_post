The elements in the input array `nums` are reordered such that `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]...`.
The relative order of the elements that satisfy the above condition is maintained.
The elements that do not satisfy the above condition may have any order among themselves.
The input array `nums` is modified in-place.
