The output is an integer representing the triangular sum of the input array `nums`.
The input array `nums` is modified according to the process described in the requirements.
The length of the modified array `nums` is either 1 or 0.
If the length of the modified array `nums` is 1, then the value of the only element in `nums` is the triangular sum.
If the length of the modified array `nums` is 0, then the triangular sum is 0.
