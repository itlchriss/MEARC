Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
- Each element in the input array `nums` is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the triangular sum of the input array `nums`.
- The input array `nums` is modified according to the process described in the requirements.
- The length of the modified array `nums` is either 1 or 0.
- If the length of the modified array `nums` is 1, then the value of the only element in `nums` is the triangular sum.
- If the length of the modified array `nums` is 0, then the triangular sum is 0.
