- The length of `triplets` is between 1 and 10^5.
- Each triplet in `triplets` is an array of three integers.
- Each element in `triplets` and `target` is between 1 and 1000.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to obtain the `target` triplet as an element of `triplets`.
- If it is possible to obtain the `target` triplet, the method returns `true`.
- If it is not possible to obtain the `target` triplet, the method returns `false`.
