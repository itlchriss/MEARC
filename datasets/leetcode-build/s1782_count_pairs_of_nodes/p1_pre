The input integer `n` represents the number of nodes in the graph.
The input 2D integer array `edges` represents the edges in the graph, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.
The input integer array `queries` represents the queries to be answered.
The length of `queries` is equal to the length of the expected output array `answers`.
The constraints on the input values are satisfied:
- `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
- `u_i != v_i`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
- `0 <= queries[j] < edges.length`
