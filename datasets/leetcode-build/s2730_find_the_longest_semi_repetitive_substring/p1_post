1. The method returns an integer representing the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring inside the input string `s`.
2. The returned length is greater than or equal to 0.
3. The returned length is less than or equal to the length of the input string `s`.
4. The returned length is the length of a valid semi-repetitive substring in the input string `s`.
5. If there are multiple valid semi-repetitive substrings with the same maximum length, the method returns the length of the first one encountered in the input string `s`.
6. If there are no valid semi-repetitive substrings in the input string `s`, the method returns 0.
