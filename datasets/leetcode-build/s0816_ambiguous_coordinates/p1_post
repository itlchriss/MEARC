The output is a list of strings representing all possibilities for the original coordinates.
The output list can be returned in any order.
All coordinates in the output list have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma).
The original representation of the coordinates never had extraneous zeroes.
The original representation of the coordinates never started with numbers like "00", "0.0", "0.00", "1.0", "001", "00.01", or any other number that can be represented with fewer digits.
A decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occurring before it.
