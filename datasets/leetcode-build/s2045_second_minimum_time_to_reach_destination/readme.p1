**Preconditions:**

The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
The input `edges` is a 2D integer array representing the edges in the graph.
The length of `edges` is at least `n - 1` and at most `2 * 10^4` or `n * (n - 1) / 2`, whichever is smaller.
Each element `edges[i]` is a 2-element array `[u_i, v_i]` representing a bi-directional edge between vertex `u_i` and vertex `v_i`.
Each vertex pair is connected by at most one edge.
No vertex has an edge to itself.
The input `time` is a positive integer representing the time taken to traverse any edge.
The input `change` is a positive integer representing the time it takes for a traffic signal to change its color from green to red or vice versa.
All signals change at the same time.
The journey starts when all signals have just turned green.

**Postconditions:**

The method returns an integer representing the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The returned time is the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum time.
The minimum time is calculated by finding the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex n, considering the time taken to traverse each edge and the time spent waiting at vertices with red signals.
The second minimum time is calculated by finding a path from vertex 1 to vertex n that has a time greater than the minimum time and is the smallest among all such paths.
The path from vertex 1 to vertex n is determined by traversing the graph using the given edges.
At each vertex, the method checks the color of the traffic signal and waits if the signal is red.
The method cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.
The method can go through any vertex any number of times, including vertices 1 and n.
Each vertex can be reached directly or indirectly from every other vertex.
