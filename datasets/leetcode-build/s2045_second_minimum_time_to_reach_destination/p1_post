**
The method returns an integer representing the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The returned time is the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum time.
The minimum time is calculated by finding the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex n, considering the time taken to traverse each edge and the time spent waiting at vertices with red signals.
The second minimum time is calculated by finding a path from vertex 1 to vertex n that has a time greater than the minimum time and is the smallest among all such paths.
The path from vertex 1 to vertex n is determined by traversing the graph using the given edges.
At each vertex, the method checks the color of the traffic signal and waits if the signal is red.
The method cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.
The method can go through any vertex any number of times, including vertices 1 and n.
Each vertex can be reached directly or indirectly from every other vertex.
