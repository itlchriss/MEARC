Preconditions:
- The input `nums` is a 2D integer array.
- The length of `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to - Each row of `nums` is a non-empty array with a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to - Each element in `nums` is an integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the final score.
- The matrix `nums` becomes empty after performing the operations.

Other possible behavioral requirements:
- The method should handle the case when `nums` is empty by returning - The method should handle the case when `nums` contains only one row by returning the maximum element in that row.
- The method should handle the case when `nums` contains only one column by returning the sum of all elements in that column.
- The method should handle the case when `nums` contains only one element by returning that element.
- The method should handle the case when all elements in `nums` are the same by returning the sum of all elements.
- The method should handle the case when there are ties for the largest number in a row by selecting any of the tied numbers.
- The method should handle the case when there are ties for the highest number among all those removed in step 1 by selecting any of the tied numbers.
