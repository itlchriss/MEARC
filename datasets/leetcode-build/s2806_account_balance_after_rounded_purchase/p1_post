The account balance after making the purchase is returned as an integer.
The account balance is calculated by subtracting the roundedAmount from the initial balance.
The roundedAmount is the nearest multiple of 10 to the purchaseAmount.
If there is more than one nearest multiple of 10, the largest multiple is chosen.
The roundedAmount is a non-negative amount.
The absolute difference between the roundedAmount and the purchaseAmount is minimized.
