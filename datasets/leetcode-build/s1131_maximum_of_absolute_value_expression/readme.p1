- The length of arr1 and arr2 must be at least - The elements in arr1 and arr2 must be integers.
- The elements in arr1 and arr2 must be within the range of -10^6 to 10^
Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer value.
- The returned value should be the maximum value of the expression |arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j|.
- The maximum value should be taken over all valid combinations of i and j, where 0 <= i, j < arr1.length.
