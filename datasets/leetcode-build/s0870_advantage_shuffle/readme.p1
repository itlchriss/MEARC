Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are not null.
- The length of `nums1` is equal to the length of `nums2`.
- The length of `nums1` is greater than or equal to - The elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
- The returned array is a permutation of `nums1`.
- The length of the returned array is equal to the length of `nums1`.
- The number of indices `i` for which `nums1[i] > nums2[i]` is maximized in the returned array.
