The output is a list of strings.
Each string in the output list has a length of exactly `maxWidth`.
The words in each string in the output list are packed in a greedy approach, with as many words as possible in each line.
Extra spaces between words in each string in the output list are distributed as evenly as possible.
If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left are assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
The last string in the output list is left-justified and does not have any extra space inserted between words.
