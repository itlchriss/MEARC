The method returns a long value representing the score obtained after applying the algorithm.
The score is the sum of the chosen integers from the input array `nums`.
All elements in the input array `nums` are marked.
The marked elements and their two adjacent elements (if they exist) are marked.
The order of marking the elements is based on the smallest unmarked integer and the smallest index in case of a tie.
