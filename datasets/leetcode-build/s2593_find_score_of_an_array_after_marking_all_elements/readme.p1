Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` is not empty.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are positive integers.
- The length of the input array `nums` is less than or equal to 10^5.
- The values of the elements in the input array `nums` are less than or equal to 10^6.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long value representing the score obtained after applying the algorithm.
- The score is the sum of the chosen integers from the input array `nums`.
- All elements in the input array `nums` are marked.
- The marked elements and their two adjacent elements (if they exist) are marked.
- The order of marking the elements is based on the smallest unmarked integer and the smallest index in case of a tie.
