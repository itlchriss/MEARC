The returned list contains the health of the remaining robots in the same order as they were given in the input.
If there are no survivors, the returned list is empty.
The health of a robot decreases by one if it collides with another robot and the other robot has a higher health.
If two robots collide and have the same health, both robots are removed from the line.
The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going.
