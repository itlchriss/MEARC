The method returns a string.
The length of the returned string is the same as the length of the input string `s`.
The returned string is the result of performing all replacement operations on `s`.
For each replacement operation, if the substring `sources[i]` occurs at index `indices[i]` in `s`, it is replaced with `targets[i]`.
If a replacement operation does not occur (the substring does not occur at the specified index), the corresponding character in the returned string remains the same as the original string `s`.
