Preconditions:
- The input `grid` is a 2D integer matrix of size `n * m`.
- The size of `grid` is within the constraints: `1 <= n == grid.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= m == grid[i].length <= 10^5`.
- The product of `n` and `m` is within the constraint: `2 <= n * m <= 10^5`.
- Each element in `grid` is within the constraint: `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^9`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a 2D integer matrix `p` of size `n * m`.
- Each element `p[i][j]` is calculated as the product of all elements in `grid` except for the element `grid[i][j]`.
- The product `p[i][j]` is taken modulo `12345`.
- The method returns the product matrix `p`.
