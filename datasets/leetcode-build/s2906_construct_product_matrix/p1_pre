The input `grid` is a 2D integer matrix of size `n * m`.
The size of `grid` is within the constraints: `1 <= n == grid.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= m == grid[i].length <= 10^5`.
The product of `n` and `m` is within the constraint: `2 <= n * m <= 10^5`.
Each element in `grid` is within the constraint: `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^9`.
