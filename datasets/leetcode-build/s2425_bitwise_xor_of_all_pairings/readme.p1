Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are not null.
- The lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` are greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer.
- The returned integer is the bitwise XOR of all integers in `nums3`.
- The length of `nums3` is equal to the product of the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The elements in `nums3` are the bitwise XOR of all pairings of integers between `nums1` and `nums2`.
