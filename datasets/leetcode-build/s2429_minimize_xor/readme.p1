Preconditions:
- The input `num1` is a positive integer.
- The input `num2` is a positive integer.
- The binary representation of `num1` has the same number of set bits as the binary representation of `num2`.

Postconditions:
- The output `x` is a positive integer.
- The binary representation of `x` has the same number of set bits as the binary representation of `num2`.
- The value of `x XOR num1` is minimal.
