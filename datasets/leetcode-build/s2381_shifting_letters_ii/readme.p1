Preconditions:
- The input string `s` is not null.
- The input string `s` is not empty.
- The input array `shifts` is not null.
- The length of the input array `shifts` is not zero.
- The length of the input string `s` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `end_i` in the `shifts` array.
- The values of `start_i` and `end_i` in each element of the `shifts` array are valid indices within the input string `s`.
- The values of `direction_i` in each element of the `shifts` array are either 0 or 1.

Postconditions:
- The output string is not null.
- The length of the output string is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
- The characters in the output string are shifted according to the specified shifts in the `shifts` array.
- Shifting a character forward means replacing it with the next letter in the alphabet, wrapping around from 'z' to 'a'.
- Shifting a character backward means replacing it with the previous letter in the alphabet, wrapping around from 'a' to 'z'.
- The output string is the final result after applying all the shifts specified in the `shifts` array.
