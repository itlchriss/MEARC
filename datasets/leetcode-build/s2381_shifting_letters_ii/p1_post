The output string is not null.
The length of the output string is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
The characters in the output string are shifted according to the specified shifts in the `shifts` array.
Shifting a character forward means replacing it with the next letter in the alphabet, wrapping around from 'z' to 'a'.
Shifting a character backward means replacing it with the previous letter in the alphabet, wrapping around from 'a' to 'z'.
The output string is the final result after applying all the shifts specified in the `shifts` array.
