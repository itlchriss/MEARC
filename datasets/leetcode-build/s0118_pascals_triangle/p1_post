The output is a list of lists of integers.
The length of the output list is equal to `numRows`.
Each inner list in the output list represents a row in Pascal's triangle.
The first element of each inner list is always 1.
The last element of each inner list is always 1.
Each element in the inner lists (except the first and last elements) is the sum of the two elements directly above it.
