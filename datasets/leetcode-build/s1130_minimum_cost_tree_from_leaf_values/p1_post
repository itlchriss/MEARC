The return value is an integer.
The return value is the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node in the binary tree.
The return value fits into a 32-bit signed integer (less than 2^31).
The binary tree has either 0 or 2 children for each node.
The values of the leaves in the binary tree correspond to the values in the input array `arr` in an in-order traversal.
The value of each non-leaf node in the binary tree is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree.
