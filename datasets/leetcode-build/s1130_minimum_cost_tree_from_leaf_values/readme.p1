Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` is not null.
- The length of the input array `arr` is at least 2 and at most 40.
- Each element in the input array `arr` is a positive integer.
- Each element in the input array `arr` is at least 1 and at most 15.

Postconditions:
- The return value is an integer.
- The return value is the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node in the binary tree.
- The return value fits into a 32-bit signed integer (less than 2^31).
- The binary tree has either 0 or 2 children for each node.
- The values of the leaves in the binary tree correspond to the values in the input array `arr` in an in-order traversal.
- The value of each non-leaf node in the binary tree is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree.
