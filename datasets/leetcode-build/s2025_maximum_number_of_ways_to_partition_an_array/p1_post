The output is an integer representing the maximum possible number of ways to partition the array.
The input array `nums` may be modified by changing the value of one element to `k`.
The input array `nums` may remain unchanged.
The number of ways to partition the array is calculated by finding the number of pivot indices that satisfy the given conditions.
The pivot index must be greater than 1 and less than the length of the array.
The sum of the elements before the pivot index must be equal to the sum of the elements after the pivot index.
The maximum number of ways to partition the array is returned.
