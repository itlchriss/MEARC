Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
- The value of `k` is within the range of -10^5 to 10^5.
- The values in the input array `nums` are within the range of -10^5 to 10^5.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the maximum possible number of ways to partition the array.
- The input array `nums` may be modified by changing the value of one element to `k`.
- The input array `nums` may remain unchanged.
- The number of ways to partition the array is calculated by finding the number of pivot indices that satisfy the given conditions.
- The pivot index must be greater than 1 and less than the length of the array.
- The sum of the elements before the pivot index must be equal to the sum of the elements after the pivot index.
- The maximum number of ways to partition the array is returned.
