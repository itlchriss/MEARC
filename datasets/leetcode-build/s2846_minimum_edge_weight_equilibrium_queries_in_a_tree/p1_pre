The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
The input `edges` is a 2D integer array of length `n - 1`, where each element `edges[i]` is a 3-element array `[u, v, w]` representing an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w`.
The input `queries` is a 2D integer array of length `m`, where each element `queries[i]` is a 2-element array `[a, b]` representing a query to find the minimum number of operations required to make the weight of every edge on the path from node `a` to node `b` equal.
The tree represented by `edges` is a valid tree, meaning it is connected and acyclic.
