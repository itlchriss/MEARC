Preconditions:
1. The `intervals` array is sorted in ascending order by the start value of each interval.
2. The `intervals` array does not contain any overlapping intervals.
3. The `newInterval` array contains two elements representing the start and end values of the new interval.
4. The start value of the new interval is greater than or equal to the start value of the first interval in the `intervals` array.
5. The end value of the new interval is less than or equal to the end value of the last interval in the `intervals` array.

Postconditions:
1. The `intervals` array is still sorted in ascending order by the start value of each interval.
2. The `intervals` array does not contain any overlapping intervals.
3. The `newInterval` has been inserted into the `intervals` array in the correct position.
4. If the new interval overlaps with any existing intervals, those intervals have been merged into a single interval.
