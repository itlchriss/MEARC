Preconditions:
1. The input array `nums` must not be null.
2. The length of the input array `nums` must be at least 3.
3. The target value must be within the range of -10^4 to 10^4.

Postconditions:
1. The method should return an integer representing the sum of the three integers in `nums` that is closest to the target.
2. The returned sum should be the closest possible sum to the target.
3. The method should return a valid sum even if there are multiple valid solutions.
4. The method should return the sum as 0 if there are no three integers in `nums` that can be summed to a value closest to the target.
