The input integers `m` and `n` must be greater than or equal to - The input matrix `coordinates` must have a length less than or equal to 10,- Each coordinate in `coordinates` must be a valid index within the grid, i.e., `0 <= coordinates[i][0] < m` and `0 <= coordinates[i][1] < n`.
The coordinates in `coordinates` must be pairwise distinct.
