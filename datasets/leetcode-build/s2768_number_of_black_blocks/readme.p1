Preconditions:
- The input integers `m` and `n` must be greater than or equal to - The input matrix `coordinates` must have a length less than or equal to 10,- Each coordinate in `coordinates` must be a valid index within the grid, i.e., `0 <= coordinates[i][0] < m` and `0 <= coordinates[i][1] < n`.
- The coordinates in `coordinates` must be pairwise distinct.

Postconditions:
- The output array `arr` must have a length of - Each element in `arr` represents the number of blocks that contain a specific number of black cells.
- The sum of all elements in `arr` must be equal to the total number of blocks in the grid.
- The order of elements in `arr` corresponds to the number of black cells in a block, starting from 0 to 4.
