The output is an array of integers.
The length of the output array is `2n - 1`.
The first element of the output array is 1.
Each integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive) occurs twice in the output array.
For every integer `i` between 2 and `n`, the distance between the two occurrences of `i` in the output array is exactly `i`.
The output array is lexicographically largest among all valid sequences that satisfy the above conditions.
