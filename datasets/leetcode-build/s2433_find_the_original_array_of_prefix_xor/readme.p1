Preconditions:
- The input array `pref` is not null.
- The length of the input array `pref` is greater than or equal to - The elements of the input array `pref` are non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
- The output array `arr` is not null.
- The length of the output array `arr` is equal to the length of the input array `pref`.
- The elements of the output array `arr` are non-negative integers.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `pref[i]` is equal to the bitwise XOR of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i`.
