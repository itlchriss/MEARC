The output is an integer representing the maximum score.
The maximum score is the frequency of the most frequent element in the final array.
The final array is obtained by performing at most `k` operations on the input array `nums`.
Each operation can either increase or decrease the value of an element in the array by 1.
The resulting array after each operation is a valid array with non-negative integers.
The elements in the resulting array are the same as the elements in the input array except for the element that was modified during the operation.
The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.
