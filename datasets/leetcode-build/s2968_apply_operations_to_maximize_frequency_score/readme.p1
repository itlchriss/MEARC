Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are integers.
- The input integer `k` is non-negative.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the maximum score.
- The maximum score is the frequency of the most frequent element in the final array.
- The final array is obtained by performing at most `k` operations on the input array `nums`.
- Each operation can either increase or decrease the value of an element in the array by 1.
- The resulting array after each operation is a valid array with non-negative integers.
- The elements in the resulting array are the same as the elements in the input array except for the element that was modified during the operation.
- The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.
