The output is an integer representing the minimum number of cuts needed to divide the circle into `n` equal slices.
The cuts are valid and can be represented by straight lines that touch points on the edge of the circle and/or its center.
The resulting slices are equal in size and shape.
The cuts divide the circle into distinct parts.
