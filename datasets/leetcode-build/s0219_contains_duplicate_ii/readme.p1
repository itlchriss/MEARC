Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` has at least two elements.
- The input integer `k` is non-negative.

Postconditions:
- The method returns `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.
- The method returns `false` if there are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.
