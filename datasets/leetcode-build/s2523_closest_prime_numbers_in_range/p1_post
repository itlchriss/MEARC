The output array `ans` is a positive integer array.
If there are multiple pairs satisfying the conditions, the pair with the minimum `nums1` value is returned.
If there are no pairs satisfying the conditions, the output array is `[-1, -1]`.
The output array `ans` contains two prime numbers `nums1` and `nums2`.
`left <= nums1 < nums2 <= right`.
`nums2 - nums1` is the minimum difference among all pairs satisfying the conditions.
