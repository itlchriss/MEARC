The input integer `n` must be greater than or equal to - The length of the input 2D integer array `roads` must be greater than or equal to - Each element `roads[i]` in the `roads` array must be an array of length - The values of `a_i` and `b_i` in each `roads[i]` array must be between 0 and `n - 1`.
The values of `a_i` and `b_i` in each `roads[i]` array must be different.
There should be no duplicate roads.
