Preconditions:
- The input matrix `mat` is not null.
- The input matrix `mat` is a binary matrix, meaning it only contains the values 0 and 1.
- There is at least one 0 in the input matrix `mat`.

Postconditions:
- The output matrix `result` has the same dimensions as the input matrix `mat`.
- For each cell in the output matrix `result`, the value represents the distance to the nearest 0 in the input matrix `mat`.
- The distance between two adjacent cells in the output matrix `result` is 1.
