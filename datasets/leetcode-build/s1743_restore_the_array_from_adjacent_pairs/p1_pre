The input `adjacentPairs` is a 2D integer array.
The length of `adjacentPairs` is equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the unknown array `nums`.
Each element in `adjacentPairs` is an array of length 2.
The elements in `adjacentPairs` are integers.
The elements in `adjacentPairs` can be positive, negative, or zero.
The elements in `adjacentPairs` can be within the range of -10^5 to 10^5.
There exists an array `nums` that has `adjacentPairs` as its pairs.
