The output is an integer array `nums`.
The length of `nums` is equal to `n`.
The elements in `nums` are unique.
Every pair of adjacent elements in `nums` is present in `adjacentPairs`.
The order of the adjacent pairs in `adjacentPairs` does not necessarily correspond to the order of the adjacent elements in `nums`.
If there are multiple solutions, any of them can be returned as the output.
