The input integer `n` must be a positive integer.
The input 2D integer array `edges` must be a valid representation of a directed acyclic graph.
The number of rows in `edges` must be less than or equal to the maximum number of edges in a directed acyclic graph with `n` nodes, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
Each row in `edges` must contain exactly 2 elements.
The elements in each row of `edges` must be integers between 0 and `n - 1`, inclusive.
The elements in each row of `edges` must be distinct.
The graph represented by `edges` must be directed and acyclic.
