The method returns an integer value representing the maximum score.
The maximum score is the number of positive integers in the array `prefix`.
The array `prefix` is obtained by rearranging the elements of `nums`.
The array `prefix` contains the prefix sums of `nums` after rearranging it.
The elements in the array `prefix` are the sum of the elements from index 0 to i in `nums` after rearranging it.
