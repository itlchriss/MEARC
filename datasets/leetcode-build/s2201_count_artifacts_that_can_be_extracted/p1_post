The method returns an integer representing the number of artifacts that can be extracted.
The artifacts are extracted by excavating cells in the grid.
If a cell is excavated and it contains a part of an artifact, that part is uncovered.
If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, it can be extracted.
The method does not modify the original grid or artifact coordinates.
