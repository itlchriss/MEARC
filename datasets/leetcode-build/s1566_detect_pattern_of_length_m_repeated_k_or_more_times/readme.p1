Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` must not be null.
- The length of the input array `arr` must be at least 2.
- The values in the input array `arr` must be positive integers.
- The length `m` of the pattern must be between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- The number of repetitions `k` must be between 2 and 100 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The method should return `true` if there exists a pattern of length `m` that is repeated `k` or more times in the input array `arr`.
- The method should return `false` if there is no pattern of length `m` that is repeated `k` or more times in the input array `arr`.
