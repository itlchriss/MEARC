Preconditions:
- The input `arr` is a 2D array of integers representing the dimensions of `n` cuboids.
- The dimensions of each cuboid in `arr` are positive integers.
- The dimensions of each cuboid in `arr` are less than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.
- The cuboids are stacked in a way that satisfies the placement conditions:
  - The width of a cuboid being placed on top is less than or equal to the width of the cuboid below.
  - The length of a cuboid being placed on top is less than or equal to the length of the cuboid below.
  - The height of a cuboid being placed on top is less than or equal to the height of the cuboid below.
- The dimensions of each cuboid can be rearranged by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.
