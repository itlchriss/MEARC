Preconditions:
1. The input string `s` is not null.
2. The input string `s` has a length greater than or equal to 2.
3. The input integer `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
4. The input integer `k` is less than or equal to the length of string `s` divided by 8.

Postconditions:
1. The output string is the longest subsequence repeated `k` times in string `s`.
2. If multiple longest subsequences are found, the output string is the lexicographically largest one.
3. If there is no subsequence repeated `k` times, the output string is empty.
