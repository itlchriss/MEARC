Preconditions:
- The input string `s` is not null.
- The length of `s` is at least 2 and at most 10^- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long value representing the maximum possible product of the lengths of two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.
- The two palindromic substrings have odd lengths.
- The two palindromic substrings are non-intersecting, meaning they do not share any common characters.
- The two palindromic substrings are chosen from different parts of the input string `s`.
- The product of the lengths of the two palindromic substrings is maximized.
