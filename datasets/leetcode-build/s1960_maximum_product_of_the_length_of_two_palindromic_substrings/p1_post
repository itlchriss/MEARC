The method returns a long value representing the maximum possible product of the lengths of two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.
The two palindromic substrings have odd lengths.
The two palindromic substrings are non-intersecting, meaning they do not share any common characters.
The two palindromic substrings are chosen from different parts of the input string `s`.
The product of the lengths of the two palindromic substrings is maximized.
