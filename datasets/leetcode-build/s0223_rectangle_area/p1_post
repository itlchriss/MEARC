The method should return an integer value representing the total area covered by the two rectangles.
The returned area should be calculated by summing the areas of the two rectangles and subtracting the overlapping area.
The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the length (difference between x-coordinates) by the width (difference between y-coordinates).
The overlapping area can be calculated by finding the intersection of the two rectangles and calculating its area.
The intersection of the two rectangles can be found by determining the maximum of the minimum x-coordinate and the minimum of the maximum x-coordinate, and the maximum of the minimum y-coordinate and the minimum of the maximum y-coordinate.
If the two rectangles do not overlap, the overlapping area should be 0.
The method should handle cases where one rectangle is completely inside the other rectangle. In such cases, the overlapping area should be equal to the area of the smaller rectangle.
