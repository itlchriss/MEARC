Preconditions:
- The input `rectangles` is a 2D array of axis-aligned rectangles.
- Each rectangle `rectangle[i]` is represented by an array of four integers `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
- The coordinates of the rectangles are within the range `0 <= xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2 <= 10^9`.
- The length of the `rectangles` array is between 1 and 
Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the total area covered by all rectangles.
- The returned area is modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- Any area covered by two or more rectangles is only counted once.
