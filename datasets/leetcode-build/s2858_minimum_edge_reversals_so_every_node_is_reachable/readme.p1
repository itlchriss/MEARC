Preconditions:
1. The input integer `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
2. The length of the `edges` array must be equal to `n - 1`.
3. Each element `edges[i]` in the `edges` array must be an array of length 2.
4. The first element `edges[i][0]` in each `edges[i]` array must be a valid node label, i.e., it must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`.
5. The second element `edges[i][1]` in each `edges[i]` array must be a valid node label, i.e., it must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`.
6. The first and second elements `edges[i][0]` and `edges[i][1]` in each `edges[i]` array must be different, i.e., they must not be equal.

Postconditions:
1. The returned array `answer` must be an array of length `n`.
2. Each element `answer[i]` in the `answer` array must be an integer.
3. The values of `answer[i]` must represent the minimum number of edge reversals required to reach any other node starting from node `i`.
4. The values of `answer[i]` must be non-negative.
