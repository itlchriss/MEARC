2. The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
3. The elements in the input array `nums` are integers.

Postconditions:
1. The output array `result` is not null.
2. The length of the output array `result` is the same as the length of the input array `nums`.
3. The elements in the output array `result` are integers.
4. For each element `nums[i]` in the input array, if there exists a next greater number, `result[i]` is the next greater number. Otherwise, `result[i]` is -1.
