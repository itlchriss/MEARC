Preconditions:
- The input arrays `edges` and `guesses` are not null.
- The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- The length of `guesses` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The integers in `edges` and `guesses` are within the range of `0` to `n - 1`.
- The integers in `edges` are distinct pairs.
- The integers in `guesses` are distinct pairs.
- The integers in `guesses` represent valid edges in the tree.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of possible root nodes.
- If there is no possible tree, the method returns `0`.
- The number of correct guesses for each possible root node is at least `k`.
