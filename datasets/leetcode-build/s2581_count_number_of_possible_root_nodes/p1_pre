The input arrays `edges` and `guesses` are not null.
The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
The length of `guesses` is greater than or equal to `k`.
The integers in `edges` and `guesses` are within the range of `0` to `n - 1`.
The integers in `edges` are distinct pairs.
The integers in `guesses` are distinct pairs.
The integers in `guesses` represent valid edges in the tree.
