The output is a list of pairs, where each pair `[a, b]` satisfies the following conditions:
- `a` and `b` are elements from the input array `arr`.
- `a` is less than `b`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is equal to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in the input array `arr`.
The output list is sorted in ascending order with respect to the pairs.
