Preconditions:
- The method should take two integer parameters, `dividend` and `divisor`.
- The `divisor` should not be equal to 0.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer value representing the quotient of `dividend` divided by `divisor`.
- The integer division should truncate towards zero, meaning the fractional part should be discarded.
- If the quotient is strictly greater than the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer, return the maximum value.
- If the quotient is strictly less than the minimum value of a 32-bit signed integer, return the minimum value.
