The output is a double value representing the maximum score.
The output is within 10^-6 of the actual answer.
The output is the sum of the averages of each subarray in the partition.
The partition must use every integer in `nums`.
The maximum score is achieved by partitioning `nums` into at most `k` non-empty adjacent subarrays.
