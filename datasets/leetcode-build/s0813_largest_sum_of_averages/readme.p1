Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements in `nums` are integers.
- The value of `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `k` is less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

Postconditions:
- The output is a double value representing the maximum score.
- The output is within 10^-6 of the actual answer.
- The output is the sum of the averages of each subarray in the partition.
- The partition must use every integer in `nums`.
- The maximum score is achieved by partitioning `nums` into at most `k` non-empty adjacent subarrays.
