The input integer `n` represents the number of courses, and it must be a positive integer.
The input 2D integer array `relations` represents the prerequisite relationships between courses. Each element `relations[j]` must be an array of length 2, where `relations[j][0]` and `relations[j][1]` represent the previous course and the next course respectively. The values of `relations[j][0]` and `relations[j][1]` must be integers between 1 and `n`, inclusive.
The input integer array `time` represents the time required to complete each course. The length of `time` must be equal to `n`, and each element `time[i]` must be a positive integer between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.
