ensures:
- The returned type_array param_answer is not null.
- The param_answer's length is equal to param_n.
- Each element in param_answer is an integer.
- The values in param_answer are either non-negative integers or -1.
requires:
- The type_integer param_n is gtoet 1.
- The type_arrays param_redEdges and param_blueEdges are not null.
- The param_redEdges's length is not gt 400.
- The param_blueEdges's length is not gt 400.
- Each element in param_redEdges is an type_array of length 2.
- Each element in param_blueEdges is an type_array of length 2.
- The values in param_redEdges and param_blueEdges are within the 0's range to `n-1`.
