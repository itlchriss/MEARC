Preconditions:
- The input `classes` is a 2D integer array.
- Each element `classes[i]` in `classes` is an array of length 2.
- The first element `classes[i][0]` in `classes[i]` represents the number of students who will pass the exam in the `i`th class.
- The second element `classes[i][1]` in `classes[i]` represents the total number of students in the `i`th class.
- The input `extraStudents` is an integer.
- The value of `extraStudents` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The length of `classes` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `classes[i][0]` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `classes[i][1]` is greater than or equal to `classes[i][0]`.
- The value of `classes[i][1]` is less than or equal to 10^5.
- The value of `extraStudents` is less than or equal to 10^5.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a double value representing the maximum possible average pass ratio after assigning the `extraStudents` students.
- The returned value is within 10^-5 of the actual answer.
