Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of `nums` is equal to `n`.
- The input array `edges` is not null.
- The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in `edges` is an array of length 2.
- The values in `edges` are valid node indices (between 0 and `n - 1`).
- The values in `edges` represent valid edges in the tree.
- The values in `nums` are positive integers.
- The values in `nums` are not null.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.
- The returned score is non-negative.
- The returned score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR values of the three components formed after removing two distinct edges.
- The three components formed after removing two distinct edges are connected.
- The XOR values of the three components are calculated correctly.
- The largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value are calculated correctly.
- The method returns the minimum score among all possible pairs of edge removals.
