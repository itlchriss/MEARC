The method returns an integer representing the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.
The returned score is non-negative.
The returned score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR values of the three components formed after removing two distinct edges.
The three components formed after removing two distinct edges are connected.
The XOR values of the three components are calculated correctly.
The largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value are calculated correctly.
The method returns the minimum score among all possible pairs of edge removals.
