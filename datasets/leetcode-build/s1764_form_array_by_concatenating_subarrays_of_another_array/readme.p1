Preconditions:
- The length of the `groups` array must be equal to `n`.
- The length of each subarray in `groups` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The sum of the lengths of all subarrays in `groups` must be less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the `nums` array must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The values in `groups` and `nums` must be within the range of -10^7 to 10^7.

Postconditions:
- The method should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to choose `n` disjoint subarrays from `nums` that match the subarrays in `groups` and satisfy the ordering condition.
- If it is possible, the method should return `true`.
- If it is not possible, the method should return `false`.
