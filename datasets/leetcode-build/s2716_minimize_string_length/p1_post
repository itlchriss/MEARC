The output is an integer denoting the length of the minimized string.
The length of the minimized string is between 1 and the length of the input string `s` (inclusive).
The minimized string is obtained by repeatedly performing the operation of deleting the closest occurrence of a character to the left and right of a chosen index in the string.
After performing the operation any number of times, the minimized string cannot be further reduced in length.
