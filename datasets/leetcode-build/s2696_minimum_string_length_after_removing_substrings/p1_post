The output is an integer representing the minimum possible length of the resulting string after removing substrings.
The resulting string is obtained by removing any occurrence of the substrings "AB" or "CD" from the input string `s`.
The resulting string may contain new occurrences of the substrings "AB" or "CD" after removing the initial occurrences.
The length of the resulting string is minimized, meaning there are no further substrings "AB" or "CD" that can be removed to reduce the length.
