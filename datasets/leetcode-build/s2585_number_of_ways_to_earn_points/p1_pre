The input `target` is a positive integer.
The input `types` is a 2D integer array with dimensions `n x 2`, where `n` is a positive integer.
Each element in `types` is a 2-element array `[count_i, marks_i]`, where `count_i` and `marks_i` are positive integers.
The sum of all `count_i` values in `types` is greater than or equal to `target`.
