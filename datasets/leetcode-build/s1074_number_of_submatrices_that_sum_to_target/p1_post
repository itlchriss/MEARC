1. The method returns an integer representing the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to the target.
2. The method does not modify the input matrix.
3. The method handles the case where the target is 0 and there are no submatrices that sum to 0.
4. The method handles the case where the target is negative and there are no submatrices that sum to the negative target.
5. The method handles the case where the target is positive and there are no submatrices that sum to the positive target.
6. The method correctly counts the number of submatrices that sum to the target.
7. The method handles the case where the target is larger than the sum of all elements in the matrix and there are no submatrices that sum to the target.
