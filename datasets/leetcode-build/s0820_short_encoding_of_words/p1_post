The output is an integer representing the length of the shortest reference string `s`.
The reference string `s` ends with the character `'#'`.
The length of the reference string `s` is equal to the sum of the lengths of all words in the input array `words`, plus the number of elements in the input array `words`.
For each index `indices[i]`, the substring of `s` starting from `indices[i]` and up to (but not including) the next `'#'` character is equal to `words[i]`.
