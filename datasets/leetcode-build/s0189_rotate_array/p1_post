The elements of the input array `nums` are rotated to the right by `k` steps.
The order of the elements in the rotated array is correct.
The rotated array is stored in the same input array `nums`.
The length of the rotated array is the same as the length of the input array `nums`.
The elements of the rotated array are the same as the elements of the input array `nums`, but in a different order.
