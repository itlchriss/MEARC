The method returns a long value representing the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.
The maximum score is calculated by distributing the marbles in a way that maximizes the sum of the costs of all the `k` bags.
The minimum score is calculated by distributing the marbles in a way that minimizes the sum of the costs of all the `k` bags.
The marbles are divided into `k` bags according to the given rules:
- No bag is empty.
- If the `i`th marble and `j`th marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the `i`th and `j`th indices should also be in that same bag.
- If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from `i` to `j` inclusively, then the cost of the bag is `weights[i] + weights[j]`.
