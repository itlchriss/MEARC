Preconditions:
- The input `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- The input `edges` is a 2D integer array of length `n - 1`, where each element `edges[i]` is an array of length 2 representing an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.
- The input `restricted` is an integer array representing the restricted nodes.
- Node `0` is not a restricted node.
- The values of `restricted` are unique.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum number of nodes that can be reached from node `0` without visiting a restricted node.
