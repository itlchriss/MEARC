Preconditions:
- The method `rand10()` should only be called after the `rand7()` method has been implemented.
- The `rand7()` method should generate a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 7]`.

Postconditions:
- The method `rand10()` should generate a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 10]`.
- The method `rand10()` should return an integer value.
- The method `rand10()` should be called `n` times, where `n` is the number of times specified in the test case.
- The output of the `rand10()` method should be an array of integers, where each integer is a random number generated in the range `[1, 10]`. The length of the array should be equal to the number of times the method is called (`n`).
