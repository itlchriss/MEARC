The method returns an integer representing the minimum total cost for the robot to return home.
The robot's final position is equal to `homePos`.
The robot has moved from `startPos` to `homePos` using the minimum cost path.
The total cost is calculated by summing the costs of each move made by the robot.
The robot can only move one cell at a time in four directions: left, right, up, or down.
The robot cannot move outside the boundary of the grid.
The cost of moving up or down into a cell is determined by the corresponding value in `rowCosts`.
The cost of moving left or right into a cell is determined by the corresponding value in `colCosts`.
