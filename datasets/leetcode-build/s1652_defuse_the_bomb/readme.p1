Preconditions:
- The input array `code` is not null.
- The length of the input array `code` is greater than 0.
- The input integer `k` is within the range `-(n - 1) <= k <= n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the input array `code`.
- Each element in the input array `code` is within the range `1 <= code[i] <= 100`.

Postconditions:
- The output array `decryptedCode` is not null.
- The length of the output array `decryptedCode` is the same as the length of the input array `code`.
- Each element in the output array `decryptedCode` is the result of replacing the corresponding element in the input array `code` according to the rules described in the requirements.
- The elements in the output array `decryptedCode` wrap around if necessary, meaning that if the index goes beyond the length of the array, it starts from the beginning.
