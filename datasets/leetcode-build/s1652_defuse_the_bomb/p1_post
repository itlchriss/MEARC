The output array `decryptedCode` is not null.
The length of the output array `decryptedCode` is the same as the length of the input array `code`.
Each element in the output array `decryptedCode` is the result of replacing the corresponding element in the input array `code` according to the rules described in the requirements.
The elements in the output array `decryptedCode` wrap around if necessary, meaning that if the index goes beyond the length of the array, it starts from the beginning.
