Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The length of the input array `nums` is even.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the minimized maximum pair sum.
- The output is the maximum sum of pairs formed from the elements in the input array `nums`.
- Each element in the input array `nums` is paired with exactly one other element.
- The maximum pair sum is minimized, meaning that there is no other possible pairing of elements that would result in a smaller maximum pair sum.
