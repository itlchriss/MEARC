The output is an integer representing the minimized maximum pair sum.
The output is the maximum sum of pairs formed from the elements in the input array `nums`.
Each element in the input array `nums` is paired with exactly one other element.
The maximum pair sum is minimized, meaning that there is no other possible pairing of elements that would result in a smaller maximum pair sum.
