Preconditions:
1. The input array `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The length of the input array `nums` is at least 1 and at most 10^5.
3. The elements in the input array `nums` are integers.
4. Each element in the input array `nums` appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Postconditions:
1. The method returns an integer, which is the single element that appears only once in the input array `nums`.
2. The method runs in O(log n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
3. The method uses O(1) space complexity.
