The output array `answer` is not null.
The length of `answer` is the same as the length of `nums`.
Each element `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.
The product of any prefix or suffix of `answer` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity.
The algorithm does not use the division operation.
Additional postcondition (follow-up):
The algorithm uses O(1) extra space complexity.
