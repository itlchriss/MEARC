**Preconditions:**

1. The input `edges` is a 2D integer array representing the message channels between servers.
2. The input `patience` is a 0-indexed integer array of length `n`, where `n` is the number of servers.
3. All servers are connected, meaning a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.
4. The server labeled `0` is the master server and the rest are data servers.
5. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply.
6. At the beginning of second `0`, each data server sends its message to be processed.

**Postconditions:**

1. The method returns the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle.
2. The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.

**Additional Preconditions:**

1. The input `n` is a positive integer.
2. The length of `patience` is equal to `n`.
3. The value of `patience[0]` is `0`.
4. The values in `patience` are positive integers.
5. The length of `edges` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the minimum of `10^5` and `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
6. Each element in `edges` is a 2-element array.
7. The values in `edges` are valid server labels (between `0` and `n-1`).
8. There are no duplicate edges in `edges`.
9. Each server can directly or indirectly reach another server.
