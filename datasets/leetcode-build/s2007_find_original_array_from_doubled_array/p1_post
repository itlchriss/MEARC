If `changed` is a doubled array, the method should return an array `original` that satisfies the following conditions:
- The length of `original` is less than or equal to the length of `changed`.
- The elements in `original` are a subset of the elements in `changed`.
- For each element `x` in `original`, there exists an element `y` in `changed` such that `x = y / 2`.
- The order of the elements in `original` can be any valid order.
If `changed` is not a doubled array, the method should return an empty array.
