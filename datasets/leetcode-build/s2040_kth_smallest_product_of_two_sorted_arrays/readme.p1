Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are not null.
- The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in ascending order.
- The length of `nums1` is greater than or equal to - The length of `nums2` is greater than or equal to - The value of `k` is greater than or equal to - The value of `k` is less than or equal to the product of the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long value representing the kth smallest product of `nums1[i] * nums2[j]`, where `i` is between 0 and the length of `nums1` minus 1, and `j` is between 0 and the length of `nums2` minus - The returned value is greater than or equal to the product of the smallest elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The returned value is less than or equal to the product of the largest elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
