The method returns a long value representing the kth smallest product of `nums1[i] * nums2[j]`, where `i` is between 0 and the length of `nums1` minus 1, and `j` is between 0 and the length of `nums2` minus - The returned value is greater than or equal to the product of the smallest elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
The returned value is less than or equal to the product of the largest elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
