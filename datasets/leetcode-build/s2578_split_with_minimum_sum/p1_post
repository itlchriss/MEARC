The method returns an integer representing the minimum possible sum of `num1` and `num2`.
The concatenation of `num1` and `num2` is a permutation of `num`.
The sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in `num1` and `num2` is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in `num`.
`num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros.
