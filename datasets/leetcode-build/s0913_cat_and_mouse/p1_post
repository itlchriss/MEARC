The method returns an integer value representing the outcome of the game:
- 1 if the mouse wins the game.
- 2 if the cat wins the game.
- 0 if the game is a draw.
The outcome of the game is determined based on the optimal moves made by both players.
If the cat occupies the same node as the mouse, the cat wins.
If the mouse reaches the hole, the mouse wins.
If a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.
