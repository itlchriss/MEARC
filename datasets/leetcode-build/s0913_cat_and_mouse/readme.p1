Preconditions:
- The input graph must be a valid undirected graph.
- The graph must have at least 3 nodes.
- Each node in the graph must be represented by a unique integer.
- The mouse starts at node 1 and the cat starts at node 2.
- There is a hole at node 0.
- The mouse and the cat can always move.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the outcome of the game:
  - 1 if the mouse wins the game.
  - 2 if the cat wins the game.
  - 0 if the game is a draw.
- The outcome of the game is determined based on the optimal moves made by both players.
- If the cat occupies the same node as the mouse, the cat wins.
- If the mouse reaches the hole, the mouse wins.
- If a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.
