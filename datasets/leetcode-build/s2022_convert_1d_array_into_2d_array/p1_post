The returned 2D array must have `m` rows and `n` columns.
The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of `original` should form the first row of the constructed 2D array.
The elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) of `original` should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.
If it is impossible to construct a valid 2D array with the given `original`, `m`, and `n`, an empty 2D array should be returned.
