Preconditions:
- The `original` array must not be null.
- The length of the `original` array must be greater than or equal to `n`.
- The values in the `original` array must be within the range of 1 to 10^- The values of `m` and `n` must be within the range of 1 to 4 * 10^
Postconditions:
- The returned 2D array must have `m` rows and `n` columns.
- The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of `original` should form the first row of the constructed 2D array.
- The elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) of `original` should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.
- If it is impossible to construct a valid 2D array with the given `original`, `m`, and `n`, an empty 2D array should be returned.
