Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` is not empty.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are positive integers.
- The length of the input array `nums` is less than or equal to 10^5.
- Each element in the input array `nums` is less than or equal to 10^6.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the number of distinct integers in the final array.
- The final array is formed by taking each integer in the input array, reversing its digits, and adding it to the end of the array.
- The final array includes the original integers from the input array.
- The final array includes the reversed integers of the original integers from the input array.
- The final array only contains distinct integers, i.e., there are no duplicates.
- The order of the integers in the final array is the same as the order in which they were added.
- The length of the final array is equal to the sum of the lengths of the input array and the number of distinct reversed integers added.
