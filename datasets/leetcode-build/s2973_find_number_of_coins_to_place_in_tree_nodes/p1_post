The output array `coin` is not null.
The length of `coin` is equal to `n`.
The values in `coin` represent the number of coins placed at each node.
For each node `i` in the tree:
- If the size of the subtree of node `i` is less than `3`, `coin[i]` is equal to `1`.
- Otherwise, `coin[i]` is equal to the maximum product of cost values assigned to `3` distinct nodes in the subtree of node `i`. If this product is negative, `coin[i]` is equal to `0`.
