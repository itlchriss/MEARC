The input array `edges` is not null.
The input array `cost` is not null.
The length of `edges` is equal to `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of nodes.
The length of `cost` is equal to `n`.
The values in `edges` are valid node indices, ranging from `0` to `n - 1`.
The values in `cost` are valid cost values, ranging from `-10^4` to `10^4`.
The input tree is undirected and rooted at node `0`.
