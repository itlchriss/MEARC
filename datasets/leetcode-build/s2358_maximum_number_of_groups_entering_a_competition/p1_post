The output is an integer representing the maximum number of groups that can be formed.
The groups are ordered in a way that the sum of grades of students in the i-th group is less than the sum of grades of students in the (i + 1)-th group, for all groups (except the last).
The total number of students in the i-th group is less than the total number of students in the (i + 1)-th group, for all groups (except the last).
