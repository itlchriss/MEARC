Preconditions:
- The input `graph` is a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`.
- The input `graph` represents a network of `n` nodes, where the `i-th` node is directly connected to the `j-th` node if `graph[i][j] == 1`.
- The input `initial` is an array of integers representing the initially infected nodes.
- The integers in `initial` are unique and within the range of `0` to `n-1`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the node that, if removed, would minimize the final number of nodes infected with malware (`M(initial)`).
- If there are multiple nodes that could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, the method returns the node with the smallest index.
