The method returns a long value representing the number of colored cells at the end of `n` minutes.
The grid is an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells.
At the first minute, any arbitrary unit cell is colored blue.
Every minute thereafter, every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell is colored blue.
The number of colored cells at the end of `n` minutes is returned.
