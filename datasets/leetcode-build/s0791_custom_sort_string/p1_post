The returned string is a permutation of `s`.
The characters in the returned string are in the same order as they appear in `order`.
If a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in `order`, then `x` occurs before `y` in the returned string.
The returned string can have any valid permutation of the characters in `s` that satisfies the above conditions.
