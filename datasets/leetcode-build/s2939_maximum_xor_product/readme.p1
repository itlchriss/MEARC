Preconditions:
- The input integers `a` and `b` must be non-negative and less than 2^50.
- The input integer `n` must be non-negative and less than or equal to 50.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned value is the maximum value of `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` for all `x` where `0 <= x < 2^n`.
- The returned value is modulo 10^9 + 7.
