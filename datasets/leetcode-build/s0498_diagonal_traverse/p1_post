1. The output array `result` is not null.
2. The length of the output array `result` is equal to the total number of elements in the input matrix `mat`.
3. The elements in the output array `result` are in diagonal order, starting from the top-left element and moving towards the bottom-right element.
4. The elements in the output array `result` are in the same order as they would be if we traverse the input matrix `mat` in a diagonal manner.
