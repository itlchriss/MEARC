The input `intervals` is a non-empty array of arrays, where each inner array represents an integer interval `[a, b]`.
Each inner array in `intervals` contains exactly two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is less than `b`.
The values of `a` and `b` in each inner array are non-negative integers and do not exceed `10^8`.
