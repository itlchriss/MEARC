Preconditions:
- The method `compareTo` takes a parameter `obj` of type `Triplet`.
- The `nums` array in the `obj` parameter is not null.
- The `nums` array in the `obj` parameter has a length greater than 0.
- The `nums` array in the `obj` parameter contains `k` lists.
- Each list in the `nums` array is not null.
- Each list in the `nums` array has a length greater than 0.
- Each list in the `nums` array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned value represents the comparison result between the current `Triplet` object and the `obj` parameter.
- If the range of the current `Triplet` object is smaller than the range of the `obj` parameter, the returned value is negative.
- If the range of the current `Triplet` object is equal to the range of the `obj` parameter, the returned value is 0.
- If the range of the current `Triplet` object is greater than the range of the `obj` parameter, the returned value is positive.
