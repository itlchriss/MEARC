The method returns an integer value.
The returned value represents the comparison result between the current `Triplet` object and the `obj` parameter.
If the range of the current `Triplet` object is smaller than the range of the `obj` parameter, the returned value is negative.
If the range of the current `Triplet` object is equal to the range of the `obj` parameter, the returned value is 0.
If the range of the current `Triplet` object is greater than the range of the `obj` parameter, the returned value is positive.
