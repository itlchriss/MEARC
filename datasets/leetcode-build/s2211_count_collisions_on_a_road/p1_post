The method returns an integer representing the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.
Additional behavioural requirements:
The method should handle the case where there are no collisions and return 0.
The method should correctly calculate the number of collisions when two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other.
The method should correctly calculate the number of collisions when a moving car collides with a stationary car.
After a collision, the cars involved should stay at the point where they collided and cannot change their state or direction of motion.
