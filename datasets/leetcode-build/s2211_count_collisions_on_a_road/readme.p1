Preconditions:
- The input string `directions` is not null.
- The length of the input string `directions` is greater than or equal to 1.
- Each character in the input string `directions` is either 'L', 'R', or 'S'.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.

Additional behavioural requirements:
- The method should handle the case where there are no collisions and return 0.
- The method should correctly calculate the number of collisions when two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other.
- The method should correctly calculate the number of collisions when a moving car collides with a stationary car.
- After a collision, the cars involved should stay at the point where they collided and cannot change their state or direction of motion.
