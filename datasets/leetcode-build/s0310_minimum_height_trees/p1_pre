The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
The input `edges` is a 2D array of size `n-1` where each element `edges[i]` is an array of size 2 representing an undirected edge between two nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.
The input tree is a connected graph without simple cycles.
The input tree is guaranteed to be a tree and there will be no repeated edges.
