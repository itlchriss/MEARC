The output is an integer.
The output is the punishment number of `n`, which is the sum of the squares of all integers `i` such that:
- `1 <= i <= n`
- The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.
