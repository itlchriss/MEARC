Preconditions:
- The length of the string `s` is even.
- The length of the 2D integer array `queries` is at least 1.
- Each query in `queries` is represented by a 4-element array.
- The first element of each query represents the starting index of the first substring.
- The second element of each query represents the ending index of the first substring.
- The third element of each query represents the starting index of the second substring.
- The fourth element of each query represents the ending index of the second substring.
- The starting index of the first substring is between 0 and `n/2`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
- The ending index of the first substring is between the starting index and `n/2`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
- The starting index of the second substring is between `n/2` and `n`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
- The ending index of the second substring is between the starting index and `n`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
- Each query is independent of the others.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a 0-indexed array `answer`.
- The length of `answer` is equal to the number of queries in `queries`.
- Each element of `answer` represents whether it is possible to make `s` a palindrome by performing the operations specified by the corresponding query.
- If it is possible to make `s` a palindrome by performing the operations specified by a query, the corresponding element in `answer` is `true`.
- If it is not possible to make `s` a palindrome by performing the operations specified by a query, the corresponding element in `answer` is `false`.
