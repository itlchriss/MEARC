The method returns a 0-indexed array `answer`.
The length of `answer` is equal to the number of queries in `queries`.
Each element of `answer` represents whether it is possible to make `s` a palindrome by performing the operations specified by the corresponding query.
If it is possible to make `s` a palindrome by performing the operations specified by a query, the corresponding element in `answer` is `true`.
If it is not possible to make `s` a palindrome by performing the operations specified by a query, the corresponding element in `answer` is `false`.
