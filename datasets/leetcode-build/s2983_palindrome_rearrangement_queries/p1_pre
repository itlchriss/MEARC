The length of the string `s` is even.
The length of the 2D integer array `queries` is at least 1.
Each query in `queries` is represented by a 4-element array.
The first element of each query represents the starting index of the first substring.
The second element of each query represents the ending index of the first substring.
The third element of each query represents the starting index of the second substring.
The fourth element of each query represents the ending index of the second substring.
The starting index of the first substring is between 0 and `n/2`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
The ending index of the first substring is between the starting index and `n/2`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
The starting index of the second substring is between `n/2` and `n`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
The ending index of the second substring is between the starting index and `n`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
Each query is independent of the others.
