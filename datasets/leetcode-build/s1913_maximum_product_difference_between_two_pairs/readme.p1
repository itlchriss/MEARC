Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the input array `nums` must be at least 4.
- The elements in the input array `nums` must be positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum product difference between two pairs.
- The maximum product difference is calculated by finding four distinct indices `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` such that the product difference between pairs `(nums[w], nums[x])` and `(nums[y], nums[z])` is maximized.
- The indices `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` must be valid indices within the input array `nums`.
- The pairs `(nums[w], nums[x])` and `(nums[y], nums[z])` must be distinct pairs.
- The maximum product difference is equal to `(nums[w] * nums[x]) - (nums[y] * nums[z])`.
