Preconditions:
- The input string `num` must not be null.
- The input array `change` must not be null.
- The length of `num` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- The length of `change` must be equal to 10.
- Each element in `change` must be an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The method returns a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating a single substring of `num`.
- The returned string is not null.
- The returned string has the same length as `num`.
- The returned string is formed by replacing each digit `num[i]` with the digit it maps to in `change` (i.e. replace `num[i]` with `change[num[i]]`).
- The returned string represents the largest number that can be created after mutating a single substring of `num`.
