The method returns a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating a single substring of `num`.
The returned string is not null.
The returned string has the same length as `num`.
The returned string is formed by replacing each digit `num[i]` with the digit it maps to in `change` (i.e. replace `num[i]` with `change[num[i]]`).
The returned string represents the largest number that can be created after mutating a single substring of `num`.
