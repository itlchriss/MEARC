Preconditions:
- The input `rec` is a 2D integer array representing `n` rectangles.
- Each rectangle `rec[i]` has a width `width_i` and a height `height_i`.
- The width and height of each rectangle are positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles in `rec`.
- Two rectangles `i` and `j` are considered interchangeable if they have the same width-to-height ratio.
- The width-to-height ratio is calculated using decimal division, not integer division.
- The method returns 0 if there are no interchangeable pairs of rectangles.
