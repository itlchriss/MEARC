The method `compareTo` should be implemented in a class that represents a `Pair` object.
The `Pair` object should have a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the graph.
The `Pair` object should have an array `edges` representing the edges in the graph.
Each element in the `edges` array should be an array of size 3, representing an edge between two nodes and its weight.
The `Pair` object should have a method `distanceToLastNode` that takes a node `x` as input and returns the shortest distance from node `n` to node `x`.
The `Pair` object should have a method `getNumberOfRestrictedPaths` that returns the number of restricted paths from node 1 to node `n`.
