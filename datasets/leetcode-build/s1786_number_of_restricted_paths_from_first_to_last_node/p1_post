The method `compareTo` should return an integer value representing the comparison between two `Pair` objects.
The returned value should be negative if the current `Pair` object has a smaller number of restricted paths than the input `Pair` object.
The returned value should be zero if the current `Pair` object has the same number of restricted paths as the input `Pair` object.
The returned value should be positive if the current `Pair` object has a larger number of restricted paths than the input `Pair` object.
