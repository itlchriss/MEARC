The method returns an integer representing the longest possible length of an array prefix of `nums`.
After removing exactly one element from the prefix, every number that has appeared in the prefix will have the same number of occurrences.
If after removing one element there are no remaining elements, it is still considered that every appeared number has the same number of occurrences (0).
