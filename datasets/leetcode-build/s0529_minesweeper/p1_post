The value at `board[click[0]][click[1]]` is updated according to the rules of the minesweeper game.
If the value at `board[click[0]][click[1]]` is `'M'`, the game is over and the value is changed to `'X'`.
If the value at `board[click[0]][click[1]]` is `'E'` and there are no adjacent mines, it is changed to `'B'` and all adjacent unrevealed squares are revealed recursively.
If the value at `board[click[0]][click[1]]` is `'E'` and there is at least one adjacent mine, it is changed to a digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) representing the number of adjacent mines.
The board is returned when no more squares will be revealed.
