Preconditions:

2. The input matrix `mat` has at least one row and one column.
3. The input matrix `mat` has no two adjacent cells that are equal.

Postconditions:
1. The output array `result` is not null.
2. The output array `result` has a length of 2.
3. The output array `result` contains valid indices `i` and `j` such that `mat[i][j]` is a peak element.
4. The output array `result` contains at least one valid peak element index.
5. The output array `result` contains only valid peak element indices.
6. The output array `result` contains distinct peak element indices.
7. The output array `result` contains peak element indices that are strictly greater than all of their adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.
8. The output array `result` contains peak element indices that are within the bounds of the input matrix `mat`.
9. The output array `result` contains peak element indices that are not on the outer perimeter of the input matrix `mat`.
10. The output array `result` contains peak element indices that are not surrounded by adjacent cells with a value of `-1`.
