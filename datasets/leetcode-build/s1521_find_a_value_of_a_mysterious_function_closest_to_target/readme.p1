Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` must not be null.
- The length of the input array `arr` must be greater than 0.
- The target value `target` must be a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
- The returned value must be an integer.
- The returned value must be the minimum possible value of `|func(arr, l, r) - target|`.
- The values of `l` and `r` used to calculate the minimum difference must satisfy the condition `0 <= l, r < arr.length`.
