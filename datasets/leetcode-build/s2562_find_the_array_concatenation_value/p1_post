The method returns a long value representing the concatenation value of `nums`.
The input array `nums` is modified such that it becomes empty after performing the operations.
The concatenation value of `nums` is calculated by repeatedly picking the first and last elements of `nums`, concatenating their values, and adding it to the concatenation value.
If `nums` has more than one element, the first and last elements are deleted after each operation.
If `nums` has only one element, it is deleted after the operation.
