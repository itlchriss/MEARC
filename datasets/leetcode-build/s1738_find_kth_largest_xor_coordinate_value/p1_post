The method returns an integer value.
The returned value is the kth largest XOR coordinate value.
The returned value is a non-negative integer.
The returned value is the XOR of all matrix[i][j] values for a given coordinate (a, b), where 0 <= a < m and 0 <= b < n.
The returned value is the XOR of all matrix[i][j] values for a given coordinate (a, b), where 0 <= i <= a < m and 0 <= j <= b < n.
The returned value is the XOR of all matrix[i][j] values for a given coordinate (a, b), where 0 <= i <= a < m and 0 <= j <= b < n, and the coordinates are 0-indexed.
The returned value is the kth largest XOR coordinate value among all the coordinates in the matrix.
The returned value is the kth largest XOR coordinate value among all the coordinates in the matrix, where the coordinates are 1-indexed.
