Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- The input `edges` is a 2D array of size `n-1` where each element `edges[i]` is an array of size 2 representing an edge connecting vertices `a_i` and `b_i`.
- The input `hasApple` is a List of size `n` where each element `hasApple[i]` is a boolean value indicating whether vertex `i` has an apple or not.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum time in seconds required to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.
