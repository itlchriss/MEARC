Preconditions:
- The input list `nums` is not null.
- The input list `nums` is not empty.
- The elements in the input list `nums` are non-negative powers of - The input integer `target` is greater than or equal to - The input integer `target` is less than 2^
Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to form a subsequence in `nums` whose elements sum to `target`.
- If it is impossible to obtain such a subsequence, the method returns -1.
