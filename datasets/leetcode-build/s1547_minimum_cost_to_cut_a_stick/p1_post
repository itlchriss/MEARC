The method should return an integer representing the minimum total cost of the cuts.
The order of the cuts can be changed.
The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut.
When a stick is cut, it will be split into two smaller sticks, and the sum of their lengths will be equal to the length of the stick before the cut.
