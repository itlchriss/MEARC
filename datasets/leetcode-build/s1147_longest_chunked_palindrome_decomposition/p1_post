The output is an integer representing the largest possible value of `k`.
The output is greater than or equal to 1.
The concatenation of all the substrings is equal to the input string `text`.
Each substring `subtext_i` is a non-empty string.
For each valid value of `i` (1 <= i <= k), `subtext_i` is equal to `subtext_k-i+1`.
