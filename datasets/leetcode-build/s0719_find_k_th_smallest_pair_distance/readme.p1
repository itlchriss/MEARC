Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the input array `nums` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- The value of `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `k` must be less than or equal to `n * (n - 1) / 2`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the `k`th smallest distance among all the pairs in the input array `nums`.
- The returned value is non-negative.
- The returned value is the absolute difference between two elements in the input array `nums`.
- The returned value is the `k`th smallest distance among all the pairs in the input array `nums`, where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.
