Preconditions:
- The integer `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The length of the `blacklist` array must be less than or equal to the minimum of 10^5 and `n - 1`.
- All values in the `blacklist` array must be unique.
- The values in the `blacklist` array must be between 0 and `n - 1`, inclusive.

Postconditions:
- The `Solution` object is initialized with the integer `n` and the `blacklist` array.
- The `pick` method returns a random integer between 0 and `n - 1` that is not in the `blacklist` array.
- The probability of each integer between 0 and `n - 1` (excluding the values in the `blacklist` array) being returned by the `pick` method is equal and is 1 divided by the number of valid integers.
