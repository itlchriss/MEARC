The `Solution` object is initialized with the integer `n` and the `blacklist` array.
The `pick` method returns a random integer between 0 and `n - 1` that is not in the `blacklist` array.
The probability of each integer between 0 and `n - 1` (excluding the values in the `blacklist` array) being returned by the `pick` method is equal and is 1 divided by the number of valid integers.
