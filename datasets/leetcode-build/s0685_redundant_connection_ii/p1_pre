The input `edges` is a 2D array of size `n`x2, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.
Each element in `edges` represents a directed edge connecting two nodes.
The graph started as a rooted tree with `n` nodes.
One additional directed edge was added to the graph.
The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n`.
The added edge was not an edge that already existed.
