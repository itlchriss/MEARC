The return value must be an integer representing the minimum number of white tiles still visible after covering with carpets.
Other possible behavioral requirements:
The method should handle the case where `floor` is an empty string and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is 0 and return the number of white tiles in `floor`.
The method should handle the case where `carpetLen` is greater than the length of `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is greater than the number of white tiles in `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is equal to the number of white tiles in `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is greater than the number of black tiles in `floor` and return the number of white tiles in `floor`.
The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is equal to the number of black tiles in `floor` and return the number of white tiles in `floor`.
