Preconditions:
- The input string `floor` must be a valid binary string, consisting of only '0' and '1' characters.
- The length of `floor` must be greater than or equal to `carpetLen`.
- The value of `numCarpets` must be greater than or equal to - The value of `carpetLen` must be greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- The return value must be an integer representing the minimum number of white tiles still visible after covering with carpets.

Other possible behavioral requirements:
- The method should handle the case where `floor` is an empty string and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is 0 and return the number of white tiles in `floor`.
- The method should handle the case where `carpetLen` is greater than the length of `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is greater than the number of white tiles in `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is equal to the number of white tiles in `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is greater than the number of black tiles in `floor` and return the number of white tiles in `floor`.
- The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is equal to the number of black tiles in `floor` and return the number of white tiles in `floor`.
- The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is greater than the number of tiles in `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is equal to the number of tiles in `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is greater than the number of white tiles in `floor` and `carpetLen` is equal to the length of `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is equal to the number of white tiles in `floor` and `carpetLen` is equal to the length of `floor` and return - The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is greater than the number of black tiles in `floor` and `carpetLen` is equal to the length of `floor` and return the number of white tiles in `floor`.
- The method should handle the case where `numCarpets` is equal to the number of black tiles in `floor` and `carpetLen` is equal to the length of `floor` and return the number of white tiles in `floor`.
