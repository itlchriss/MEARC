Preconditions:
- `quadTree1` and `quadTree2` are valid Quad-Trees.
- `quadTree1` and `quadTree2` represent `n * n` binary matrices.

Postconditions:
- The returned Quad-Tree represents the `n * n` binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrices represented by `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`.
- The returned Quad-Tree is a valid Quad-Tree.
- The returned Quad-Tree has the same size as `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`.
- The returned Quad-Tree has the same structure as `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`, except for the values of the nodes.
