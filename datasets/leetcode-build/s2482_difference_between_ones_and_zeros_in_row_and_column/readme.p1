Preconditions:
- The input `grid` is a 2D array of integers.
- The length of `grid` is equal to `m`.
- The length of each row in `grid` is equal to `n`.
- The values in `grid` are either 0 or 1.

Postconditions:
- The output is a 2D array of integers.
- The length of the output array is equal to `m`.
- The length of each row in the output array is equal to `n`.
- The values in the output array are calculated based on the formula `onesRow[i] + onesCol[j] - zerosRow[i] - zerosCol[j]`, where `onesRow[i]` is the number of ones in the `i`th row, `onesCol[j]` is the number of ones in the `j`th column, `zerosRow[i]` is the number of zeros in the `i`th row, and `zerosCol[j]` is the number of zeros in the `j`th column.
