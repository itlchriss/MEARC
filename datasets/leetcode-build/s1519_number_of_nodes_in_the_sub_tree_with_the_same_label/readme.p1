Preconditions:
- The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- The input `edges` is a 2D array of size `n-1` representing the edges of the tree.
- The input `labelsString` is a string of length `n` representing the labels of each node in the tree.

Postconditions:
- The output is an array of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `i-th` node which have the same label as node `i`.
- The output array is in the same order as the nodes in the tree.
- The output array contains only non-negative integers.
