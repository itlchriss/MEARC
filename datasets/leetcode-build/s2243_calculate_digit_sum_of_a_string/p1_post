The string `s` is divided into consecutive groups of size `k`.
Each group of `s` is replaced with a string representing the sum of all its digits.
The consecutive groups are merged together to form a new string.
If the length of the new string is greater than `k`, repeat the process from step 1.
Return the final string `s` after all rounds have been completed.
