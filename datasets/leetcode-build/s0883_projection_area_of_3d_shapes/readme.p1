Preconditions:
- The input grid is a square grid with dimensions n x n.
- Each value in the grid represents the number of cubes placed on top of the corresponding cell.
- The dimensions of the grid and the values in the grid are within the specified constraints.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the total area of all three projections.
