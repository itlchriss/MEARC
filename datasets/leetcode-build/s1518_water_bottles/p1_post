The method should return an integer value representing the maximum number of water bottles that can be drunk.
The number of water bottles that can be drunk is calculated by adding `numBottles` with the integer division of `numBottles` by `numExchange`, and adding 1 to the result.
The method should handle the case when `numBottles` is less than `numExchange` and return `numBottles` as the result.
