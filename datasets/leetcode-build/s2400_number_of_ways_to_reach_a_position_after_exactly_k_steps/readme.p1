Preconditions:
- The input integers `startPos`, `endPos`, and `k` are positive.
- The value of `startPos` is less than or equal to `endPos`.
- The value of `k` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `endPos` and `startPos`.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the number of different ways to reach the position `endPos` starting from `startPos` in exactly `k` steps.
- The output is modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- If it is impossible to reach position `endPos` from position `startPos` in exactly `k` steps, the output is 0.
