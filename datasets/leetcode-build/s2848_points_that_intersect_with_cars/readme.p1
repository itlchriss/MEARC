- The integers in each sublist represent the starting and ending points of a car.
- The starting point is less than or equal to the ending point for each car.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of integer points on the line that are covered with any part of a car.
- The returned value is greater than or equal to 0.
- The returned value is less than or equal to 100.
- The returned value is the sum of the lengths of all intervals formed by the starting and ending points of the cars, minus the number of overlapping points.
- The returned value is the sum of the lengths of all intervals formed by the starting and ending points of the cars, minus the number of overlapping points, plus 1.
