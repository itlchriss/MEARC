1. The input graph must be represented as a 2D array.
2. The graph must be undirected.
3. The graph must have n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n-1.
4. The graph must satisfy the following properties:
 a. There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
 b. There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
 c. If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
 d. The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
