The output array `arr` is not null.
The length of the output array `arr` is equal to the length of the input array `nums`.
The elements in the output array `arr` are non-negative integers.
For each index `i` in the output array `arr`, if there exists an index `j` such that `nums[j] == nums[i]` and `j != i`, then `arr[i]` is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between `i` and all indices `j` where `nums[j] == nums[i]`. Otherwise, `arr[i]` is equal to 0.
