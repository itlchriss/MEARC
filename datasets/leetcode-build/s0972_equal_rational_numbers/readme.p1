Preconditions:
- The input strings `s` and `t` are non-null.
- The input strings `s` and `t` represent non-negative rational numbers.
- The input strings `s` and `t` follow the specified format for representing rational numbers.
- The `<IntegerPart>` of `s` and `t` does not have leading zeros (except for the zero itself).
- The length of the `<IntegerPart>` of `s` and `t` is between 1 and 4 (inclusive).
- The length of the `<NonRepeatingPart>` of `s` and `t` is between 0 and 4 (inclusive).
- The length of the `<RepeatingPart>` of `s` and `t` is between 1 and 4 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The method returns `true` if and only if `s` and `t` represent the same rational number.
- The method correctly identifies when the repeating part of the rational number is denoted within a pair of round brackets.
- The method correctly compares the non-repeating parts of `s` and `t` when they are present.
- The method correctly compares the repeating parts of `s` and `t` when they are present.
- The method correctly handles cases where the non-repeating part of `s` or `t` is missing.
- The method correctly handles cases where the repeating part of `s` or `t` is missing.
- The method correctly handles cases where the non-repeating part of `s` or `t` is longer than the specified maximum length of 4.
- The method correctly handles cases where the repeating part of `s` or `t` is longer than the specified maximum length of 4.
