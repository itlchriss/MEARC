The method returns an array `answer`.
The length of `answer` is equal to the length of `queries`.
Each element in `answer` is an integer.
Each element in `answer` is the maximum value of `nums1[j] + nums2[j]` among all indices `j` where `nums1[j] >= xi` and `nums2[j] >= yi`, or -1 if there is no `j` satisfying the constraints.
