Preconditions:
- The lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` are equal.
- The length of `nums1` is equal to `n`.
- The length of `queries` is greater than or equal to - Each query in `queries` has a length of - The values in `nums1` and `nums2` are integers.
- The values in `nums1` and `nums2` are greater than or equal to - The values in `nums1` and `nums2` are less than or equal to 10^- The values in `queries` are integers.
- The values in `queries` are greater than or equal to - The values in `queries` are less than or equal to 10^
Postconditions:
- The method returns an array `answer`.
- The length of `answer` is equal to the length of `queries`.
- Each element in `answer` is an integer.
- Each element in `answer` is the maximum value of `nums1[j] + nums2[j]` among all indices `j` where `nums1[j] >= xi` and `nums2[j] >= yi`, or -1 if there is no `j` satisfying the constraints.
