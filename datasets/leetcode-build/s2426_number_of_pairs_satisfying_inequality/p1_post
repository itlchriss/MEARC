The method returns an integer representing the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
The returned value is greater than or equal to 0.
The returned value is less than or equal to the total number of pairs that can be formed from the indices of `nums1` and `nums2`.
For each pair `(i, j)` that satisfies the conditions, the following must hold:
- `0 <= i < j <= n - 1`
- `nums1[i] - nums1[j] <= nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff`
