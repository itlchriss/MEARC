The method returns an integer representing the length of the shortest clear path in the grid.
If there is no clear path, the method returns -1.
Additional behavioural requirements:
The method should handle the case when the grid is empty (n = 0) and return -1.
The method should handle the case when the grid has only one cell (n = 1) and return 1 if the cell is clear (0) or -1 if the cell is blocked (1).
The method should handle the case when the grid has no clear path and return -1.
The method should handle the case when the grid has a clear path and return the correct length of the path.
The method should consider all 8-directional connections when determining the clear path.
The method should not modify the input grid.
