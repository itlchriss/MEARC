Preconditions:
- The input grid is a square matrix of size n x n.
- The grid contains only binary values (0 or 1).
- The top-left cell of the grid is (0, 0).
- The bottom-right cell of the grid is (n - 1, n - 1).

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the length of the shortest clear path in the grid.
- If there is no clear path, the method returns -1.

Additional behavioural requirements:
- The method should handle the case when the grid is empty (n = 0) and return -1.
- The method should handle the case when the grid has only one cell (n = 1) and return 1 if the cell is clear (0) or -1 if the cell is blocked (1).
- The method should handle the case when the grid has no clear path and return -1.
- The method should handle the case when the grid has a clear path and return the correct length of the path.
- The method should consider all 8-directional connections when determining the clear path.
- The method should not modify the input grid.
