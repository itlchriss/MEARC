The method returns an integer representing the number of possible combinations that add up to the target.
The returned integer is a 32-bit integer.
Additional behavioural requirements:
The method should handle the case when the input array `nums` is empty and return 0.
The method should handle the case when the target integer `target` is 0 and return 1 (as there is one possible combination: an empty combination).
The method should handle the case when the target integer `target` is negative and return 0 (as there are no possible combinations that add up to a negative target).
The method should handle the case when the input array `nums` contains negative integers and return the correct number of possible combinations that add up to the target.
