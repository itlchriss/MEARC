Preconditions:
- The input grid is a 2D integer matrix.
- The grid is not null.
- The grid has at least one row and one column.
- The grid is a valid grid, meaning that all elements in the grid are non-negative integers and less than m * n.
- The bottom-right cell of the grid is reachable, meaning that grid[m - 1][n - 1] is equal to 0.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of cells needed to visit to reach the bottom-right cell.
- If there is no valid path to reach the bottom-right cell, the method returns -1.
