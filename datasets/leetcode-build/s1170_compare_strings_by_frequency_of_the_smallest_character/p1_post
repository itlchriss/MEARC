The returned array `answer` is not null.
The length of `answer` is equal to the length of `queries`.
Each element in `answer` is an integer.
The order of elements in `answer` corresponds to the order of queries in `queries`.
For each query `queries[i]`, `answer[i]` is the number of words in `words` such that `f(queries[i])` < `f(W)` for each `W` in `words`.
