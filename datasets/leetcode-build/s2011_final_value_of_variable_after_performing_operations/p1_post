The return value is an integer representing the final value of `X` after performing all the operations.
The value of `X` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `"++X"` or `"X++"`.
The value of `X` is decremented by 1 for each occurrence of `"--X"` or `"X--"`.
The final value of `X` is the sum of all the increments and decrements performed on `X`.
