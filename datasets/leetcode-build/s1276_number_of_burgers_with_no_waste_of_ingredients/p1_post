If it is possible to make the remaining `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` equal to 0, the method should return a list `[total_jumbo, total_small]` where `total_jumbo` represents the number of jumbo burgers and `total_small` represents the number of small burgers.
If it is not possible to make the remaining `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` equal to 0, the method should return an empty list `[]`.
