- The input matrix `grid` has at least one row and one column.
- The input matrix `grid` contains only non-negative integers.
- The input integer `k` is positive.

Postconditions:
- The return value is an integer.
- The return value is greater than or equal to 0.
- The return value is less than or equal to 10^9 + 7.
- The return value represents the number of paths from position (0, 0) to position (m - 1, n - 1) in the matrix `grid` where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by `k`.
