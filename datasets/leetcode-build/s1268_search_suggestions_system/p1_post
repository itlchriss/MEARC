The method returns a list of lists of suggested products.
The outer list has the same length as the `searchWord` string.
Each inner list contains at most three product names.
The product names in each inner list have a common prefix with the corresponding prefix of the `searchWord` string.
If there are more than three products with a common prefix, the three lexicographically minimum products are returned.
The order of the suggested products is the same as the order of the characters in the `searchWord` string.
