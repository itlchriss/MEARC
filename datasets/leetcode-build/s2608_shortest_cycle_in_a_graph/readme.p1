Preconditions:
- The input `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
- The input `edges` is a 2D integer array representing the edges in the graph.
- Each element in `edges` is an array of size 2, representing an edge between two vertices.
- The vertices in `edges` are labeled from 0 to `n - 1`.
- Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge.
- No vertex has an edge to itself.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the length of the shortest cycle in the graph.
- If no cycle exists, the method returns -1.
