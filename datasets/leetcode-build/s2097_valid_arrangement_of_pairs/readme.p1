Preconditions:
- The input `pairs` is a 2D integer array.
- The length of `pairs` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- Each element in `pairs` is an array of length 2.
- The values of `start_i` and `end_i` in each pair are integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- The value of `start_i` is not equal to the value of `end_i` for each pair.
- No two pairs in `pairs` are exactly the same.

Postconditions:
- The output is a 2D integer array.
- The length of the output is the same as the length of `pairs`.
- For every index `i` where 1 <= i < pairs.length, `end_i-1` is equal to `start_i` in the output.
