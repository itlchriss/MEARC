The input `pairs` is a 2D integer array.
The length of `pairs` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
Each element in `pairs` is an array of length 2.
The values of `start_i` and `end_i` in each pair are integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).
The value of `start_i` is not equal to the value of `end_i` for each pair.
No two pairs in `pairs` are exactly the same.
