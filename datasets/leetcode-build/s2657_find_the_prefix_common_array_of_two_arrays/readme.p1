Preconditions:
- The input arrays `A` and `B` are not null.
- The length of arrays `A` and `B` is equal.
- The length of arrays `A` and `B` is at least 1.
- The elements in arrays `A` and `B` are integers.
- The elements in arrays `A` and `B` are positive integers.
- The elements in arrays `A` and `B` are unique.
- The elements in arrays `A` and `B` are in the range from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the arrays.

Postconditions:
