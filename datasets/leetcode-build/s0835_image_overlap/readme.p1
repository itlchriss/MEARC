Preconditions:
- The input matrices `img1` and `img2` are square matrices of size `n x n`.
- The values in the matrices `img1` and `img2` are either `0` or `1`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the largest possible overlap between the two images.
- The overlap is calculated by counting the number of positions that have a `1` in both images.
- The translation of one image does not include any kind of rotation.
- Any `1` bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.
