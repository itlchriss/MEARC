The output array `result` is not null.
The length of `result` is 2.
The first element of `result` represents the x-coordinate and is an integer between 0 and 50.
The second element of `result` represents the y-coordinate and is an integer between 0 and 50.
The network quality at the coordinate represented by `result` is maximum.
If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate is returned.
