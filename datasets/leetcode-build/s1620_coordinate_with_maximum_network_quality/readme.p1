Preconditions:
- The input array `towers` is not null.
- The length of `towers` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- Each element in `towers` is an array of length 3.
- The first element of each tower array represents the x-coordinate and is an integer between 0 and 50.
- The second element of each tower array represents the y-coordinate and is an integer between 0 and 50.
- The third element of each tower array represents the quality factor and is an integer between 0 and 50.
- The input integer `radius` is between 1 and 50.

Postconditions:
- The output array `result` is not null.
- The length of `result` is 2.
- The first element of `result` represents the x-coordinate and is an integer between 0 and 50.
- The second element of `result` represents the y-coordinate and is an integer between 0 and 50.
- The network quality at the coordinate represented by `result` is maximum.
- If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate is returned.
