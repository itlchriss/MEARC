- The length of the input array `nums` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The elements in the input array `nums` are positive integers.
- The input integer `threshold` is greater than or equal to the length of the input array `nums`.

Postconditions:
- The output is an integer representing the smallest divisor such that the sum of the division's result is less than or equal to the input `threshold`.
- The output is a positive integer.
- The output is a divisor of all the elements in the input array `nums`.
- The sum of the division's result using the output divisor is less than or equal to the input `threshold`.
