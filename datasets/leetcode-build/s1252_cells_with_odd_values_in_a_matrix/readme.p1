Preconditions:
- The input matrix is initialized to all 0's.
- The indices array is not null.
- The length of the indices array is not greater than 100.
- The values of m and n are between 1 and 50 (inclusive).
- The values of ri and ci in the indices array are between 0 and m-1 (inclusive) and 0 and n-1 (inclusive) respectively.

Postconditions:
- The matrix is modified by incrementing the cells on the specified rows and columns.
- The final matrix contains the number of odd-valued cells.
- The output is an integer representing the number of odd-valued cells in the final matrix.
- The time complexity of the method is O(n + m + indices.length).
- The space complexity of the method is O(n + m).
