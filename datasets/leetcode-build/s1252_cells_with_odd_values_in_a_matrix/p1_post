The matrix is modified by incrementing the cells on the specified rows and columns.
The final matrix contains the number of odd-valued cells.
The output is an integer representing the number of odd-valued cells in the final matrix.
The time complexity of the method is O(n + m + indices.length).
The space complexity of the method is O(n + m).
