The method returns an integer representing the city with the smallest number of reachable cities within the distance threshold. If there are multiple cities with the same smallest number, the method returns the city with the greatest number.
The method calculates the distance of a path connecting cities `i` and `j` by summing the weights of the edges along that path.
The method determines the neighboring cities at a distance threshold for each city and returns the city with the smallest number of neighboring cities within the distance threshold.
