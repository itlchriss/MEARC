The input integer `n` represents the number of cities and must be greater than or equal to 2.
The input array `edges` represents the bidirectional and weighted edges between cities and must have a length greater than or equal to 1.
Each element `edges[i]` in the `edges` array is an array of length 3, where `edges[i][0]` represents the starting city, `edges[i][1]` represents the destination city, and `edges[i][2]` represents the weight of the edge. The starting city and destination city must be integers between 0 and `n-1`.
The input integer `maxDist` represents the maximum distance threshold and must be greater than or equal to 1.
