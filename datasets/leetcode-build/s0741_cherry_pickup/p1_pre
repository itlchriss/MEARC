The input grid is a square grid of size n x n.
The grid contains only three possible integers: 0, 1, and -1.
The starting position (0, 0) and the ending position (n - 1, n - 1) are valid positions in the grid.
The starting position (0, 0) contains a cherry (1) that can be picked up.
The ending position (n - 1, n - 1) is not a thorn (-1).
