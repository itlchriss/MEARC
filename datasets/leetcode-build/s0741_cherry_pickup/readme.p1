Preconditions:
- The input grid is a square grid of size n x n.
- The grid contains only three possible integers: 0, 1, and -1.
- The starting position (0, 0) and the ending position (n - 1, n - 1) are valid positions in the grid.
- The starting position (0, 0) contains a cherry (1) that can be picked up.
- The ending position (n - 1, n - 1) is not a thorn (-1).

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum number of cherries that can be collected.
- The grid is modified such that all picked cherries (1) are replaced with empty cells (0).
- If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1), the method returns 0.
