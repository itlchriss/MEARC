The method returns a list of lists of integers, representing the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.
Each inner list represents an interval and contains two integers: the start index and the end index (inclusive) of the group.
The intervals are sorted in increasing order by start index.
If there are no large groups in the input string, an empty list is returned.
