The output is a list of pairs of distinct indices `(i, j)` from the input list `words`.
The concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]` is a palindrome for each pair `(i, j)` in the output list.
The output list contains all possible pairs of distinct indices `(i, j)` such that the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]` is a palindrome.
