Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer array parameter `fronts` and `backs` must not be null.
- The integer result is the smallest good integer after flipping the cards.
- If there are no good integers, the integer result is 0.
- Flipping a card swaps the front and back numbers.
- A good integer is one where the integer printed on the back of the card is not printed on the front of any other card.
