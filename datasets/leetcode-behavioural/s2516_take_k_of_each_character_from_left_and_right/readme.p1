- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of the string `s`.
- The integer result is the minimum number of minutes needed to take at least `k` of each character from the string `s`, or -1 if it is not possible.
- The characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' are considered distinct and must be taken into account separately.
- The characters must be taken from the leftmost or rightmost position of the string `s` in each minute.
- The result is calculated based on the minimum number of minutes needed to achieve at least `k` occurrences of each character.
