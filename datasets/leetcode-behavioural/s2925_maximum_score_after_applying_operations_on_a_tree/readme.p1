- The integer array parameter `edges` must have a length of `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` must be an array of length 2, representing an edge between two nodes.
- The integer array parameter `values` must have a length of `n`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `values` must be between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- The integer result is the maximum score obtainable after performing operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains healthy.
- The tree is considered healthy if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.
