- The integer parameter `num` must have a length greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 200.
- The integer values in the list result must be non-negative and fit in a 32-bit signed integer type (0 <= f[i] < 2^31).
- The length of the list result must be greater than or equal to 3.
- For all indices i such that 0 <= i < length of list result - 2, the sum of f[i] and f[i + 1] must be equal to f[i + 2].
- Each piece of the split sequence in the list result must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.
- If it is impossible to split the string `num` into a Fibonacci-like sequence, an empty list [] must be returned.
