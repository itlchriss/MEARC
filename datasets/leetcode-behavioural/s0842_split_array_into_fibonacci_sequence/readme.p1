- The integer parameter `num` must have a length greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 200.
- The integer values in the Fibonacci-like sequence result must be non-negative and fit in a 32-bit signed integer type.
- Each piece in the Fibonacci-like sequence result must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.
- The length of the Fibonacci-like sequence result must be greater than or equal to 3.
- The sum of each pair of consecutive elements in the Fibonacci-like sequence result must be equal to the next element in the sequence.
- If it is impossible to split the string `num` into a Fibonacci-like sequence, the method must return an empty list.
