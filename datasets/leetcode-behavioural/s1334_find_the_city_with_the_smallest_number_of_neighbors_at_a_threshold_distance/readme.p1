Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` represents the number of cities.
- The integer 2D array parameter `edges` represents the bidirectional and weighted edges between cities.
- The integer parameter `maxDist` represents the maximum distance threshold.
- The integer result is the city with the smallest number of reachable cities within the distance threshold, with the greatest number taking precedence in case of ties.
