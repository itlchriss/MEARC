- The integer array parameter `nums` must be 0-indexed and comprise of `n` non-negative integers.
- In one operation, the integer `i` chosen must satisfy `1 <= i < n` and `nums[i] > 0`.
- After each operation, the maximum integer value in the array `nums` must be minimized.
- The method must return the minimum possible value of the maximum integer in the array `nums` after performing any number of operations.
