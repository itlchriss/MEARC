- The integer result is the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of string parameter `s` so that string parameter `t` becomes a subsequence of string parameter `s`.
- The length of string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of string parameter `t` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The characters appended to the end of string parameter `s` must be in the same order as they appear in string parameter `t`.
- Appending any fewer characters than the minimum required to make `t` a subsequence of `s` will not achieve the desired result.
