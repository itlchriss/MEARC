- If the integer matrix parameter `graph` represents a network of `n` nodes where the `i-th` node is directly connected to the `j-th` node if `graph[i][j] == 1`, and some nodes in the integer list parameter `initial` are initially infected by malware, the integer result is the node that, if removed, would minimize the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops.
- If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops, the integer result is the node with the smallest index among those nodes.
