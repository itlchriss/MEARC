- The integer matrix parameter `graph` represents a network of nodes where `graph[i][j] == 1` indicates a direct connection between node `i` and node `j`.
- The integer array parameter `initial` contains nodes initially infected by malware.
- Malware spreads between directly connected nodes, infecting both nodes if at least one is infected.
- The final number of nodes infected with malware after the spread stops is denoted as `M(initial)`.
- The method must return the node that, when removed from the `initial` list, would minimize `M(initial)`.
- If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, the method should return the node with the smallest index.
- If a node is removed from the `initial` list, it may still get infected later due to malware spread.
