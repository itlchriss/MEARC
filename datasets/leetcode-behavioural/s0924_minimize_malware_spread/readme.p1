- If a node is removed from the `initial` list of infected nodes, it might still be infected later due to the malware spread.
- The integer array parameter `initial` contains unique values.
- The integer array parameter `initial` is not empty.
- The integer array parameter `initial` is not null.
- The integer array parameter `initial` contains values that are within the range of 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the adjacency matrix `graph`.
- The integer result is the node that, if removed, would minimize the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops.
- If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize the final number of nodes infected with malware, the method should return the node with the smallest index.
