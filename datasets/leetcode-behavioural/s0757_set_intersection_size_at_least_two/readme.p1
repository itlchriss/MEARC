Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `intervals` is a two-dimensional array with a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3000.
- Each sub-array in the `intervals` array has a length of 2.
- The integers `a` and `b` in each sub-array are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 100000000.
- The integer result is the minimum size of a set `S` such that for every integer interval `A` in `intervals`, the intersection of `S` with `A` has a size of at least two.
