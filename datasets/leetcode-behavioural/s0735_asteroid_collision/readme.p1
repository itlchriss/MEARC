- If two asteroids with opposite directions collide, the smaller asteroid will explode, and the larger asteroid will continue moving in its original direction.
- If two asteroids with the same size collide, both asteroids will explode.
- If two asteroids are moving in the same direction, they will never collide.
- The resulting state of the asteroids after all collisions should be returned as an integer array.
