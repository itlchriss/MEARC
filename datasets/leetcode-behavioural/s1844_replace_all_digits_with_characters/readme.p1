- For every odd index `i`, the character at index `i` in the string `s` is replaced with the character obtained by shifting the character at index `i-1` by the value of the digit at index `i`.
- The result string after replacing all digits is returned.
- The function `shift(c, x)` returns the `x`-th character after character `c`.
- The character obtained by shifting will never exceed `'z'`.
- The length of the input string `s` is between 1 and 100.
