- The integer array parameter `nums` must be a 0-indexed array.
- The integer result is the sum of beauty of all `nums[i]` where `1 <= i <= nums.length - 2`.
- The beauty of `nums[i]` is calculated as follows:
    - If `nums[j] < nums[i] < nums[k]` for all `0 <= j < i` and for all `i < k <= nums.length - 1`, the beauty is 2.
    - If `nums[i - 1] < nums[i] < nums[i + 1]` and the previous condition is not satisfied, the beauty is 1.
    - If none of the previous conditions hold, the beauty is 0.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.
