- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must consist of positive integers.
- The integer result is the answer after performing the described operations.
- The number of columns decreases by one after each operation.
- For each operation, the element with the greatest value from each row is deleted. If multiple such elements exist, any of them can be deleted.
- The maximum of the deleted elements is added to the answer.
- The final answer is the sum of all the maximum values added during each operation.
