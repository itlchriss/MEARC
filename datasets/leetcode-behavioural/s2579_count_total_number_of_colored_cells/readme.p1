- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The long result is the number of colored cells at the end of `n` minutes.
- The number of colored cells at the end of `n` minutes is determined by coloring any arbitrary unit cell blue at the first minute and then coloring blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell in subsequent minutes.
- The number of colored cells at the end of `n` minutes is calculated based on the grid representation where cells are colored blue based on the touching blue cells.
- The grid representation and coloring mechanism follow the described routine for `n` minutes.
