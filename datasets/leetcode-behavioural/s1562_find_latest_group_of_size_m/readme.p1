- The integer array parameter `arr` represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
- The binary string of size n initially has all its bits set to zero.
- At each step i from 1 to n, the bit at position arr[i] is set to 1.
- The integer parameter `m` represents the length of the group of ones to be found.
- The integer result is the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length exactly m.
- If no such group exists, the integer result is -1.
