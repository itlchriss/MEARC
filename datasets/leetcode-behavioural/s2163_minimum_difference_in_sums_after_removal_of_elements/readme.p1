- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length of `3 * n`.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the minimum possible difference between the sums of the two parts after the removal of `n` elements.
- The difference in sums is calculated as `sum_first - sum_second`.
- The minimum difference is the smallest value obtained after removing `n` elements and dividing the remaining array into two equal parts.
- The elements to be removed must form a subsequence of size exactly `n`.
- The remaining `2 * n` elements are divided into two equal parts.
- The difference in sums is calculated as the sum of the first `n` elements minus the sum of the next `n` elements.
- The minimum difference is returned as the final result.
