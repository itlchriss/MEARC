- The integer array parameter `seats` and the integer array parameter `students` have the same length `n`.
- The integer array parameter `seats` and the integer array parameter `students` have values between 1 and 100.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.
- The result is calculated by moving each student from their initial position to the corresponding seat position.
- The number of moves required to move a student from one position to another is the absolute difference between the two positions.
- The total number of moves is the sum of the moves required for each student.
- If there are multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning, the moves should be calculated accordingly.
- The result is greater than or equal to 0.
