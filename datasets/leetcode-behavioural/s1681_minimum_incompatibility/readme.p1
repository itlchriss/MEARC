- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array `nums`.
- The integer result is the minimum possible sum of incompatibilities of the `k` subsets after distributing the array optimally.
- If it is not possible to distribute the array into `k` subsets where no two elements are equal in the same subset, the integer result is equal to -1.
