- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the list parameter `connections` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer values `a_i` and `b_i` in each connection list are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than `n`.
- The values of `a_i` and `b_i` in each connection list are not equal.
- There are no repeated connections in the list parameter `connections`.
- The result is a list of lists containing critical connections in the network.
- The critical connections are represented as pairs of servers `[a_i, b_i]` that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach other servers.
