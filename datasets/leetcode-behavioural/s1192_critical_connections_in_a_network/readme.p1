- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the list parameter `connections` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and is less than or equal to 100000.
- Each element in the list parameter `connections` is a list of two integers `[a, b]` where `0 <= a, b <= n - 1` and `a != b`.
- There are no repeated connections in the list parameter `connections`.
- The result is a list of lists containing critical connections in the network in any order.
- Each element in the result list is a list of two integers `[a, b]` representing a critical connection where `0 <= a, b <= n - 1` and `a != b`.
