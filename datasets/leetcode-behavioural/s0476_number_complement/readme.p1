- The integer parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than 2^31.
- The integer result is the complement of the integer parameter `num`.
- The binary representation of the integer result is obtained by flipping all `0`'s to `1`'s and all `1`'s to `0`'s in the binary representation of the integer parameter `num`.
