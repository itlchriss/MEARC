- The integer array parameter `timeSeries` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The integer parameter `duration` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 10^7.
- The integer result is the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.
- If Teemo attacks Ashe at second `t`, Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`.
- If Teemo attacks Ashe again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end `duration` seconds after the new attack.
