- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The length of the integer array parameter `blacklist` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the minimum of 10^5 and `n` - 1.
- All values in the integer array parameter `blacklist` are unique.
- The `Solution` class constructor initializes the object with the integer `n` and the blacklisted integers `blacklist`.
- The `pick` method returns a random integer in the range `[0, n - 1]` that is not in `blacklist`.
- Any integer in the mentioned range and not in `blacklist` should be equally likely to be returned.
- The `pick` method should minimize the number of calls to the built-in random function of the language.
