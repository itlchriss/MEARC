- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `blacklist` is less than or equal to the minimum of 100000 and `n` minus 1.
- All values in the integer array parameter `blacklist` are unique.
- The integer result of the `pick()` method is a random integer in the range `[0, n - 1]` and not in `blacklist`.
- Any integer in the range `[0, n - 1]` that is not in `blacklist` should be equally likely to be returned.
- The `pick()` method should minimize the number of calls to the built-in random function.
