- The integer array parameter `nums` contains values associated with each node in the tree.
- The 2D integer array parameter `edges` represents the edges between nodes in the tree.
- The integer array result `ans` has a size of `n`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Each element in the integer array result `ans` represents the closest ancestor to the corresponding node such that the values of the node and its ancestor are coprime.
- If there is no such ancestor for a node, the corresponding element in the integer array result `ans` is equal to -1.
