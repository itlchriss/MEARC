- The integer 2D array parameter `properties` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100000.
- Each element in the integer 2D array parameter `properties` must have a length of 2.
- The integer result is the number of weak characters in the game.
- A character is considered weak if there exists another character with both attack and defense levels strictly greater than the character's attack and defense levels.
- The attack and defense levels of the characters are determined by the values in the 2D integer array parameter `properties`.
- The attack level of a character is represented by the first element in each sub-array of `properties`.
- The defense level of a character is represented by the second element in each sub-array of `properties`.
