- The string parameter `target` consists only of English lowercase letters.
- The string result is a sequence of moves that makes the answer equal to the `target` in the minimum number of moves.
- The moves include 'U' to move the position up one row, 'D' to move the position down one row, 'L' to move the position left one column, 'R' to move the position right one column, and '!' to add the character `board[r][c]` at the current position `(r, c)` to the answer.
