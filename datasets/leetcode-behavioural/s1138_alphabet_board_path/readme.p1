- The string parameter `target` consists only of English lowercase letters.
- The string result is a sequence of moves that makes the answer equal to the `target` in the minimum number of moves.
- The moves are represented by characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and '!' where:
    - 'U' moves the position up one row if the position exists on the board.
    - 'D' moves the position down one row if the position exists on the board.
    - 'L' moves the position left one column if the position exists on the board.
    - 'R' moves the position right one column if the position exists on the board.
    - '!' adds the character `board[r][c]` at the current position `(r, c)` to the answer.
- The board is represented by the 2D array `board = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"]`.
- The starting position is `(0, 0)` corresponding to the character `board[0][0]`.
