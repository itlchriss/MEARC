Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `graph` is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.
- The integer result is a list of all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`.
- Each path in the result is represented as a list of integers.
- The order of paths in the result list is arbitrary.
- Each element in the result list is a valid path from node `0` to node `n - 1` in the given DAG.
- The input graph `graph` is guaranteed to be a DAG.
- The input graph `graph` has `n` nodes where `2 <= n <= 15`.
- All elements in `graph[i]` are unique and satisfy `0 <= graph[i][j] < n`.
- There are no self-loops in the input graph.
- The result list may contain multiple paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`.
