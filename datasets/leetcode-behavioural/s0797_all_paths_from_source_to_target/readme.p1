Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `graph` is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.
- The integer result is a list of all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`.
- Each path in the result is represented as a list of integers.
- The order of paths in the result list is arbitrary.
- Each node in the graph can be visited from its parent node.
- There are no self-loops in the graph.
- All nodes in the graph are unique.
- The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
