Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` represents a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
- The integer result is the number of different ways to reorder `nums` so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array `nums`.
- The integer result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
