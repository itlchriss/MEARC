- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a 2D array of size `m x n`, where `m` and `n` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- The integer matrix result `answer` must be of size `m x n`.
- The value of each cell `(r, c)` in the matrix `answer` is calculated based on the number of distinct values in the top-left diagonal and bottom-right diagonal of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the matrix `grid`.
- The value of `answer[r][c]` is equal to the absolute difference between the number of distinct values in the top-left diagonal and bottom-right diagonal of the cell `(r, c)` in the matrix `grid`.
