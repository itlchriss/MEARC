- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.
- The boolean result is true if the binary representation of the integer parameter `n` has alternating bits.
- The boolean result is false if the binary representation of the integer parameter `n` does not have alternating bits.
