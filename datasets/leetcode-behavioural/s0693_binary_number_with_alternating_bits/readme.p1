- The integer parameter `n` must be a positive integer.
- If the binary representation of the integer parameter `n` has alternating bits (i.e., two adjacent bits have different values), the boolean result is true.
- If the binary representation of the integer parameter `n` does not have alternating bits (i.e., two adjacent bits have the same value), the boolean result is false.
