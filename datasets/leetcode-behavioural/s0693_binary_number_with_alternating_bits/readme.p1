- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.
- If the binary representation of the integer parameter `n` has alternating bits (i.e., two adjacent bits have different values), the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
- If the binary representation of the integer parameter `n` does not have alternating bits, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
