- The string parameters `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` must consist of lowercase English letters.
- The length of the string parameters `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The characters in `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are equivalent characters.
- The equivalency relation follows reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity rules.
- The lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr` is returned based on the equivalency information from `s1` and `s2`.
- The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
- The output string is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr`.
