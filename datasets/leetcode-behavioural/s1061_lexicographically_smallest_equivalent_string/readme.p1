- The string parameters `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` must consist of lowercase English letters.
- The length of the string parameters `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` must be between 1 and 1000.
- The characters in `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are considered equivalent.
- The equivalence relation between characters must follow reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.
- The lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr` must be returned based on the equivalency information from `s1` and `s2`.
- The characters in each group of equivalent characters must be sorted in lexicographical order.
- The output string must have the same length as `baseStr`.
