- The integer array parameter `original` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 40000.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 40000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `original` must be divisible by the integer parameter `n`.
- The number of rows in the 2D array result is equal to the integer parameter `m`.
- The number of columns in the 2D array result is equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- The elements from indices 0 to n-1 (inclusive) of the integer array `original` form the first row of the constructed 2D array.
- The elements from indices n to 2n-1 (inclusive) of the integer array `original` form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.
- If it is impossible to construct the 2D array according to the above procedure, an empty 2D array is returned.
