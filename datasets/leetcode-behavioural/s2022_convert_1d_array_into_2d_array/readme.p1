- The integer array parameter `original` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 40000.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 40000.
- If it is possible to construct a 2D array with `m` rows and `n` columns using all elements from `original` following the specified procedure, the 2D array result contains `m` rows and `n` columns.
- If it is impossible to construct a 2D array with `m` rows and `n` columns using all elements from `original` following the specified procedure, the result is an empty 2D array.
