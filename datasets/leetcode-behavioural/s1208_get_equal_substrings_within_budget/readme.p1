- The integer result is the maximum length of a substring of string `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of string `t` with a cost less than or equal to the integer parameter `maxCost`.
- The length of the substring is determined by the number of characters that can be changed within the cost constraint.
- If there is no substring from string `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from string `t` within the cost constraint, the integer result is equal to 0.
- The strings `s` and `t` must have the same length.
- The integer parameter `maxCost` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1000000.
- The strings `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.
