- The integer result is the maximum length of a substring of string `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of string `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.
- The length of the substring of string `s` that can be changed is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of string `s`.
- The cost of changing the substring of string `s` to the corresponding substring of string `t` is less than or equal to `maxCost`.
- If there is no substring from string `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from string `t`, the integer result is 0.
