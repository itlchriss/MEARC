- The integer parameter `rowIndex` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 33.
- The size of the integer list result is equal to the integer parameter `rowIndex` plus one.
- Each element in the integer list result is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in Pascal's triangle.
- The algorithm should use only O(rowIndex) extra space.
