- The character matrix parameter `board` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `click` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `click` is 2.
- The integer array parameter `click` contains valid indices within the bounds of the character matrix `board`.
- The character matrix `board` is updated according to the rules specified in the business requirement.
- If a mine 'M' is revealed, the character matrix `board` should change it to 'X'.
- If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, the character matrix `board` should change it to 'B' and reveal all adjacent unrevealed squares recursively.
- If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, the character matrix `board` should change it to a digit representing the number of adjacent mines.
- The updated character matrix `board` is returned when no more squares will be revealed.
