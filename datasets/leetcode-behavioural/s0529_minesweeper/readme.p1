- The integer array parameter `click` must have a length of 2.
- The integer array parameter `click` must contain valid indices within the bounds of the `board` matrix.
- The char matrix `board` must have dimensions `m x n` where `m` and `n` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- The char matrix `board` must only contain characters 'M', 'E', 'B', or digits from '1' to '8'.
- If a mine 'M' is revealed at the click position, the character at that position in the `board` matrix must be changed to 'X'.
- If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed at the click position, the character at that position in the `board` matrix must be changed to 'B' and all adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
- If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed at the click position, the character at that position in the `board` matrix must be changed to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
- The method must return the updated `board` matrix after revealing the click position according to the specified rules.
