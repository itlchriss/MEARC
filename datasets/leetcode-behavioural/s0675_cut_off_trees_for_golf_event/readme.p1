- The integer result is the minimum steps needed to walk to cut off all the trees in the forest.
- If it is impossible to cut off all the trees, the integer result is -1.
- The forest is represented as an m x n matrix.
- The value 0 in the matrix represents a cell that cannot be walked through.
- The value 1 in the matrix represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
- A number greater than 1 in the matrix represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and the number represents the tree's height.
- The trees in the forest have unique heights.
- The trees must be cut off in order from shortest to tallest.
- The starting point to cut off trees is at (0, 0).
- The steps can be taken in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west.
