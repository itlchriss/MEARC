- The integer parameter `index` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than the length of the mountain array.
- The integer result is the element of the mountain array at the specified index.
- The length of the mountain array is greater than or equal to 3.
- There exists an index `i` such that `0 < i < length - 1` where the elements before `i` are in ascending order and the elements after `i` are in descending order.
- The integer result is the minimum index where the element at that index is equal to the target. If such an index does not exist, the result is -1.
