- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 50000.
- The integer result is the number of operations required to make all elements in the integer array `nums` equal.
- The largest value in the integer array `nums` is found, and its index `i` and value `largest` are determined. If there are multiple elements with the largest value, the smallest `i` is picked.
- The next largest value in the integer array `nums` that is strictly smaller than `largest` is found, and its value is determined as `nextLargest`.
- The integer array `nums[i]` is reduced to `nextLargest`.
- The number of operations to make all elements in the integer array `nums` equal is returned.
