- The string parameter `code` must be wrapped in a valid closed tag.
- A closed tag in the code must have the format `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`.
- The TAG_NAME in the start and end tags must be the same for a closed tag to be valid.
- A valid TAG_NAME must only contain uppercase letters and have a length in the range [1,9].
- A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata, and any characters except unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tags, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME.
- An unmatched start tag is one where no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. Consider the issue of unbalanced nesting of tags.
- An unmatched `<` is one where a subsequent `>` cannot be found. All characters between `<` and the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME.
- CDATA has the format `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`, and the CDATA_CONTENT is the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`.
- CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters and should be treated as regular text, not parsed as a tag.
- The method must return true if the code snippet is valid according to the specified rules, and false otherwise.
