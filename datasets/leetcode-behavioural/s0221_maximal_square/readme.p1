- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must be a binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's.
- The integer result is the area of the largest square containing only 1's in the binary matrix `matrix`.
- The area of the square is calculated by counting the number of 1's in the square.
- The area of the square is greater than or equal to 0.
- The area of the square is less than or equal to the total number of elements in the binary matrix `matrix`.
- The dimensions of the binary matrix `matrix` are `m x n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- The number of rows `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 300.
- The number of columns `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 300.
