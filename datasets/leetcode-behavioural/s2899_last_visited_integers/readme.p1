- The integer list result contains the last visited integers based on the given algorithm.
- For each occurrence of the string "prev" in the input list `words`, the last visited integer is determined as per the specified algorithm.
- If the total number of consecutive "prev" strings seen so far is greater than the total visited integers, the last visited integer will be -1.
