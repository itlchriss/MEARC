- If the mouse wins the game, the integer result is 1.
- If the cat wins the game, the integer result is 2.
- If the game is a draw, the integer result is 0.
- The integer result is based on the optimal gameplay of both players.
- The input graph must be a 2D array representing the graph where each index `i` contains a list of nodes that are connected to node `i`.
- The length of the graph array is between 3 and 50.
- Each node in the graph array contains unique connected nodes.
- The nodes in the graph array are represented by integers from 0 to the length of the graph array.
- The mouse starts at node 1, the cat starts at node 2, and there is a hole at node 0.
- The game ends when the cat occupies the same node as the mouse, the mouse reaches the hole, or a position is repeated.
- The game outcome is determined by the above conditions and the optimal gameplay of both players.
