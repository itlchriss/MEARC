- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `queries` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `queries` is equal to the size of the array `answer`.
- For each integer `queries[i]`, the integer result `answer[i]` is the maximum number of points that can be obtained by starting in the top left cell of the matrix and following the specified process.
- If `queries[i]` is strictly greater than the value of the current cell, one point is obtained if it is the first time visiting the cell, and movement to any adjacent cell in all 4 directions is allowed.
- If `queries[i]` is not strictly greater than the value of the current cell, no points are obtained, and the process ends.
- For each query, it is allowed to visit the same cell multiple times.
