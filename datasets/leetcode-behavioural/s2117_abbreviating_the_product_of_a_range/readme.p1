- If the number of digits in the product is greater than 10, the product is abbreviated as "<pre>...<suf>eC".
- If the number of digits in the product is less than or equal to 10, the product remains unchanged.
- The string result represents the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range `[left, right]`.
