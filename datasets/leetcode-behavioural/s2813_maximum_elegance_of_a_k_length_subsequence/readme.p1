Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `items` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `items` is equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `items` is an array of length 2.
- The first element of each array in the integer array parameter `items` is the profit and is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The second element of each array in the integer array parameter `items` is the category and is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer result is the maximum elegance of a subsequence of `items` with size exactly `k`.
