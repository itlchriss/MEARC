- The integer parameters `x` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `points` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10000.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `points` must be an array of length 2 where both elements are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the index of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from the current location `(x, y)`.
- If there are multiple valid points with the smallest Manhattan distance, the valid point with the smallest index is returned.
- If there are no valid points, the result is -1.
