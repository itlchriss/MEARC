Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `upper` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array `colsum`.
- The integer parameter `lower` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array `colsum`.
- All values in the integer array parameter `colsum` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 2.
- The length of the list result is 2.
- Each element in the list result is a list of integers.
- The sum of elements in the 0-th row of the matrix is equal to the integer parameter `upper`.
- The sum of elements in the 1-st row of the matrix is equal to the integer parameter `lower`.
- The sum of elements in the i-th column of the matrix is equal to the i-th element of the integer array `colsum`.
