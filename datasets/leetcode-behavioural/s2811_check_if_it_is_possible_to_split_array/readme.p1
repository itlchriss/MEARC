Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer list parameter `nums` has a length of `n` where `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 200.
- The boolean result is true if it is possible to split the array `nums` into `n` non-empty arrays following the given conditions, otherwise the result is false.
- In each step of splitting, an existing array with a length of at least two can be selected and split into two subarrays.
- For each resulting subarray after splitting, at least one of the following conditions must hold:
    - The length of the subarray is one.
    - The sum of elements of the subarray is greater than or equal to `m`.
