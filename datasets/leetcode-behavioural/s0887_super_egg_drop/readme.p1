- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves needed to determine with certainty the value of `f`.
- The minimum number of moves is calculated based on the described scenario where eggs are dropped from different floors to determine the breaking point.
- The minimum number of moves is determined by dropping eggs strategically to minimize the number of moves required to find the breaking point.
- The method does not reveal the actual value of `f` but focuses on determining it with certainty within the minimum number of moves.
