- The string parameter `secret` and the string parameter `guess` must consist of digits only.
- The length of the string parameter `secret` and the string parameter `guess` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the string parameter `secret` is equal to the length of the string parameter `guess`.
- The string result is formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows.
- The number of bulls represents the digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of cows represents the digits in the guess that are in the secret number but are located in the wrong position.
- The bulls are counted first before counting the cows.
- If a digit in the guess can be rearranged to match a digit in the secret number, it is counted as a cow.
- If there are duplicate digits in the guess and secret number, they should be handled correctly in counting bulls and cows.
