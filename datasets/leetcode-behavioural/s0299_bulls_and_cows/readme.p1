- The string parameter `secret` and the string parameter `guess` must consist of digits only.
- The length of the string parameter `secret` and the string parameter `guess` must be between 1 and 1000.
- The length of the string parameter `secret` must be equal to the length of the string parameter `guess`.
- The string result is formatted as "xAyB" where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows.
- Bulls are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- Cows are digits in the guess that are in the secret number but are located in the wrong position.
- Only one of the two unmatched digits is counted as a cow if the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one digit to be a bull.
