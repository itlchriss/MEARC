- The resulting integer after performing the operations described above is returned.
- The string parameter `s` must consist of lowercase English letters.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10.
- The resulting integer is the sum of digits after converting the string `s` into an integer and transforming it `k` times.
- The conversion involves replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26).
- The transformation involves replacing the integer with the sum of its digits.
- The transformation operation is repeated `k` times in total.
