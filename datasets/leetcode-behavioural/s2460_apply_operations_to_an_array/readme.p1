- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 2000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- After performing all operations, the resulting array must have all `0`'s shifted to the end of the array.
- Each operation is applied sequentially on the array elements.
- If `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`, then the `i`-th element is multiplied by `2` and the `i + 1`-th element is set to `0`.
- If `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]`, the operation is skipped.
