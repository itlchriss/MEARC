- The integer parameter `s` must be a binary string consisting only of zeroes and ones.
- The integer result is the length of the longest balanced substring of the binary string `s`.
- A substring is considered balanced if all zeroes are before ones and the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring.
- The empty substring is considered a balanced substring.
