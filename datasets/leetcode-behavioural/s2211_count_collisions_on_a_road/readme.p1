- The total number of collisions is an integer result.
- The string parameter `directions` must not be null.
- The length of the string parameter `directions` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The characters in the string parameter `directions` are either 'L', 'R', or 'S'.
- The total number of collisions is calculated based on the collisions between cars moving in opposite directions and between moving cars and stationary cars.
- When two cars moving in opposite directions collide, the number of collisions increases by 2.
- When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by 1.
