- The integer parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The integer parameter `t` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The integer result is the maximum achievable number after applying the given operation no more than `t` times.
- The maximum achievable number is calculated by increasing or decreasing `x` by 1, and simultaneously increasing or decreasing `num` by 1, until `x` becomes equal to `num` after at most `t` operations.
