Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The integer parameter `t` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The integer result is the maximum achievable number `x` after applying the given operation no more than `t` times.
- The maximum achievable number `x` can become equal to `num` after applying the operation of increasing or decreasing `x` by 1 and simultaneously increasing or decreasing `num` by 1 no more than `t` times.
