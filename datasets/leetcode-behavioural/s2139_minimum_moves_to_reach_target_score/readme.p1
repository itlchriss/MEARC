- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `maxDoubles` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves needed to reach the integer parameter `target` starting with 1.
- The result is achieved by either incrementing the current integer by one or doubling the current integer.
- The increment operation can be used any number of times.
- The double operation can be used at most `maxDoubles` times.
