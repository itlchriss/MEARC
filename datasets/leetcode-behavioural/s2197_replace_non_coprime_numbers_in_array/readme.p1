- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The values in the final modified array are less than or equal to 10^8.
- The integer result is a list of integers representing the final modified array after replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers with their LCM.
- If no two adjacent numbers in the `nums` array are non-coprime, the process stops and the final modified array is returned.
- The process of finding and replacing two adjacent non-coprime numbers with their LCM is repeated until no more such pairs are found.
- The order in which adjacent non-coprime numbers are replaced with their LCM does not affect the final result.
- The final modified array is returned as a list of integers.
