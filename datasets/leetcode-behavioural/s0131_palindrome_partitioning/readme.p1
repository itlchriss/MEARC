- The string parameter `s` must not be null.
- The length of the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 16.
- The result is a list of lists of strings, where each inner list represents a palindrome partitioning of the string `s`.
- Each inner list contains substrings of `s` that form palindromes.
- Each substring in the inner list is a palindrome.
- The inner lists in the result are unique.
- The substrings in each inner list are in the same order as they appear in the original string `s`.
