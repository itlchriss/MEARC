- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 15.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is equal to `n-1`.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` is an array of length 2 representing a bidirectional edge between cities.
- The integer array result has a size of `n-1`.
- Each element in the integer array result represents the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to `d`, where `d` ranges from 1 to `n-1`.
- The distance between two cities is defined as the number of edges in the path between them.
