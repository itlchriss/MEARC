- The integer array parameter `intervals` is a non-overlapping array of intervals sorted in ascending order by the start of each interval.
- The integer array parameter `newInterval` represents another interval to be inserted into the `intervals` array.
- The integer array result is the `intervals` array after inserting the `newInterval` such that the `intervals` array remains sorted in ascending order by the start of each interval and does not have any overlapping intervals.
- If the `newInterval` overlaps with existing intervals in the `intervals` array, the overlapping intervals should be merged.
- The length of the integer array result may be greater than, equal to, or less than the length of the input `intervals` array.
- The start and end values of the intervals in the `intervals` array and the `newInterval` are within the constraints specified in the context.
- The result should follow the same format as the input, with each interval represented as a pair of start and end values.
