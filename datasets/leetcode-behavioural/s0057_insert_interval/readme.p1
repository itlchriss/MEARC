- The integer array parameter `intervals` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by the first element of each interval.
- The integer array parameter `newInterval` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `newInterval` represents a non-overlapping interval.
- The integer array result is the `intervals` array after inserting `newInterval` such that the intervals are still sorted in ascending order by the first element of each interval and there are no overlapping intervals.
- If the `newInterval` overlaps with existing intervals in `intervals`, the overlapping intervals are merged appropriately.
