- The integer result is the size of the largest subset of binary strings `strs` such that there are at most `m` 0's and `n` 1's in the subset.
- The size of the subset is less than or equal to the size of the input array `strs`.
- The subset must contain only elements from the input array `strs`.
- The subset must have at most `m` 0's and `n` 1's.
- The subset must be the largest possible subset that satisfies the above conditions.
