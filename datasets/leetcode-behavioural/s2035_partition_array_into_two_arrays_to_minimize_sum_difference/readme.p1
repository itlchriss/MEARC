- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length of `2 * n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 15.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -10^7 and are less than or equal to 10^7.
- The integer result is the minimum possible absolute difference of the sums of two arrays after partitioning the `nums` array into two arrays of length `n`.
- The absolute difference between the sums of the two arrays is calculated as abs(sum of array 1 - sum of array 2).
- The output format should be a list with '-' as bullets.
