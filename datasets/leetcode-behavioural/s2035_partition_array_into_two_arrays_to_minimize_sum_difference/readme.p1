- The integer array parameter `nums` has a length of `2 * n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 15.
- The integer array parameter `nums` contains integers within the range of -10^7 to 10^7.
- The integer result is the minimum possible absolute difference of the sums of two arrays after partitioning the `nums` array into two arrays of length `n`.
- The absolute difference is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the sums of the two arrays.
- The output format is a list with '-' as bullets.
