Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer 2D array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` contain unique ids and are sorted in ascending order by id.
- The resulting integer 2D array must be sorted in ascending order by id.
- Each id in the resulting array should be included only once, and its value should be the sum of the values of this id in the two input arrays.
- If an id does not exist in one of the input arrays, its value in that array is considered to be 0.
