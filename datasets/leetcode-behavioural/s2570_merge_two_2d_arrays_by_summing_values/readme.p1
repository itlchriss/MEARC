- The integer 2D array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- Each sub-array in the integer 2D array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must have a length of 2.
- Each sub-array in the integer 2D array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must contain unique ids.
- Each sub-array in the integer 2D array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must be sorted in ascending order by id.
- The integer 2D array result must be sorted in ascending order by id.
- Each id in the resulting array should be included only once.
- The value of each id in the resulting array should be the sum of the values of this id in the two input arrays.
- If an id does not exist in one of the input arrays, its value in that array is considered to be 0.
