- The integer array parameter `arr` is a permutation of integers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.
- The integer result is the largest number of chunks that can be made to sort the array.
- The result is greater than or equal to 1.
- The result is less than or equal to the length of the array `arr`.
- Splitting the array into chunks and sorting each chunk should result in a sorted array.
- All elements in the array `arr` are unique.
