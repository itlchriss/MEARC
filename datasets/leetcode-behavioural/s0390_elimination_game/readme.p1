- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The integer result is the last remaining number in the list `arr` after applying the elimination game algorithm.
- The list `arr` must be initialized with all integers in the range `[1, n]` in strictly increasing order.
- After each iteration of the elimination game algorithm, the list `arr` must be updated according to the specified rules.
- The elimination game algorithm must alternate between removing numbers from left to right and right to left until only one number remains in the list `arr`.
