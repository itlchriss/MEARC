- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the last number that remains in the list `arr` after applying the specified algorithm.
- The length of the list `arr` decreases by half in each iteration until a single number remains.
- The algorithm alternates between removing numbers from left to right and right to left.
- The algorithm removes every other number in each iteration.
- The algorithm starts by removing the first number from the list.
