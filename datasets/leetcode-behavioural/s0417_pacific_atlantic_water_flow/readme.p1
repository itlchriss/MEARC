- The 2D list result contains grid coordinates where rainwater can flow from a cell to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
- Each element in the result list is a list of two integers representing the row and column indices of a cell.
- The integer matrix parameter `heights` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `heights` has a length `m` and each row has a length `n`.
- The values in the integer matrix parameter `heights` are between 0 and 100000.
- The length of the result list is not fixed and can vary based on the input matrix `heights`.
- The result list contains unique grid coordinates.
