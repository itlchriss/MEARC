- The 2D list result contains grid coordinates where rainwater can flow from a cell to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
- Each element in the result list is a list of two integers [r, c] representing the row and column indices of a cell.
- The integer matrix parameter `heights` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `heights` has a length m and each row has a length n.
- The integer values in the matrix `heights` are between 0 and 10^5.
- The result list may contain duplicate coordinates if multiple paths exist for water to flow to both oceans from the same cell.
- The result list should not contain coordinates outside the bounds of the matrix `heights`.
- The result list should be in the same order as the cells are visited during the traversal process.
