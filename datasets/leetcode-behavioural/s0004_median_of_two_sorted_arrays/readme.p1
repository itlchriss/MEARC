- The double result is the median of the two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The overall run time complexity of the method should be O(log (m+n)).
- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to `m`.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums2` is equal to `n`.
- The integer result is within the range of -10^6 to 10^6.
- The integer result is rounded to five decimal places.
- If the length of the merged array of `nums1` and `nums2` is odd, the median is the middle element.
- If the length of the merged array of `nums1` and `nums2` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
