Method behavioural requirements:
- If there are two adjacent characters in the string parameter `s` where one is a lower-case letter and the other is the same letter but in upper-case, those two characters are removed until there are no more such adjacent characters.
- The resulting string after removing all such adjacent characters is returned.
