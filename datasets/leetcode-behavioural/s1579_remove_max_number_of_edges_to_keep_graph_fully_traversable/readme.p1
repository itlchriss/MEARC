- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of 100000 and 3 times `n` times `n-1` divided by 2.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` is an array of length 3.
- The integer array parameter `edges` contains distinct tuples.
- The integer result is the maximum number of edges that can be removed to allow the graph to be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob.
- If it is impossible for the graph to be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob, the integer result is -1.
