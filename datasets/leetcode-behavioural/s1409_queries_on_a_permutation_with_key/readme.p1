- The integer array parameter `queries` contains positive integers between 1 and `m`.
- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `queries` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `m`.
- The integer array result contains the result for each query in the `queries` array.
- For each query `queries[i]`, the position of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P` is found (indexing from 0) and then `queries[i]` is moved to the beginning of the permutation `P`.
- The result for each query is the position of the query in the updated permutation `P`.
- The result array contains the results for all the queries in the same order as they appear in the `queries` array.
