- The integer array parameter `arr` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameter `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100.
- The boolean result is true if there exists a pattern of length `m` that is repeated `k` or more times consecutively in the integer array parameter `arr`.
- The boolean result is false if there is no pattern of length `m` that is repeated `k` or more times consecutively in the integer array parameter `arr`.
