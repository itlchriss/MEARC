- The integer matrix parameter `mat` is a 2D grid where no two adjacent cells are equal.
- The integer matrix parameter `mat` has an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.
- The integer matrix parameter `mat` has dimensions m x n where m and n are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 500.
- The integer result is a length 2 array [i, j] representing a peak element mat[i][j].
- The peak element mat[i][j] is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.
- The algorithm must run in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.
