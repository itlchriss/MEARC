- The integer 2D array parameter `mat` must not be null.
- The integer array result is a length 2 array containing the indices `[i,j]` of a peak element in the 2D grid `mat`.
- The peak element at index `[i,j]` must be strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.
- The algorithm must run in `O(m log(n))` or `O(n log(m))` time.
