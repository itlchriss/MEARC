- The Quad-Tree node `val` attribute can be assigned either True or False when `isLeaf` is False.
- The Quad-Tree node `isLeaf` attribute must be True if the node is a leaf node and False if the node has four children.
- The Quad-Tree node must have four children: `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, and `bottomRight`.
- The Quad-Tree can be constructed from a two-dimensional area by following the steps mentioned in the context.
- The Quad-Tree format for input/output is serialized using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator with no node below.
- The Quad-Tree node representation in the serialized format is a list `[isLeaf, val]`, where True is represented as 1 and False is represented as 0.
- The Quad-Tree must be valid and represent a `n * n` grid.
- The size of the grid `n` must be a power of 2, where `n = 2^x` and `0 <= x <= 9`.
