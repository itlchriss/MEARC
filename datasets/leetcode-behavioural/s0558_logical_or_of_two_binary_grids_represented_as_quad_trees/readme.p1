- The Quad-Tree node `val` attribute can be assigned the value of `True` or `False` when `isLeaf` attribute is `False`.
- The Quad-Tree node `isLeaf` attribute must be `True` if the node represents a grid of 1's or 0's, and `False` if the node has four children.
- The Quad-Tree node must have four children: `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, and `bottomRight`.
- The Quad-Tree node must be constructed by following the steps mentioned in the context.
- The Quad-Tree node must be serialized using level order traversal with `[isLeaf, val]` representation.
- The Quad-Tree node must be able to perform logical bitwise OR operation on two binary matrices represented by two Quad-Trees.
