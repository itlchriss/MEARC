- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have the same length `n`.
- All values in the integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 10^7.
- The integer result is the XOR sum of the rearranged `nums2` array that minimizes the XOR sum with `nums1`.
- The length of the integer array result is 1.
