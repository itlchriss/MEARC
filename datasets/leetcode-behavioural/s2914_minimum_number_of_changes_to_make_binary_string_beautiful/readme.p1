- The integer parameter `s` has an even length.
- The integer result is the minimum number of changes required to make the binary string `s` beautiful.
- The binary string `s` can be partitioned into one or more substrings, each with an even length and containing only `1`'s or only `0`'s.
- Each character in the binary string `s` can be changed to `0` or `1` to achieve the beautiful partitioning.
- The minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful is calculated based on the constraints provided.
