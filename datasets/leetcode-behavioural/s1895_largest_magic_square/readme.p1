Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer 2D array parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer result is the size `k` of the largest magic square that can be found within the integer 2D array `grid`.
- The size `k` represents the side length of the largest magic square.
- The integers in the magic square do not have to be distinct.
- Every row sum, column sum, and diagonal sum of the magic square must be equal.
- The integers in the magic square must satisfy the condition that every row sum, every column sum, and both diagonal sums are all equal.
- The size `k` of the largest magic square must be returned as the integer result.
