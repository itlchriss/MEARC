- The boolean result is true if it is possible to form the integer array `arr` from the integer arrays in `pieces` without reordering the integers within each array.
- The boolean result is false if it is not possible to form the integer array `arr` from the integer arrays in `pieces` without reordering the integers within each array.
- The length of the integer array `arr` is greater than or equal to the length of the integer array `pieces`.
- The sum of the lengths of all integer arrays in `pieces` is equal to the length of the integer array `arr`.
- Each integer array in `pieces` contains distinct integers.
- The integers in the integer array `arr` are distinct.
- The integers in the integer arrays in `pieces` are distinct.
- The integer array `arr` and the integer arrays in `pieces` are not modified during the process of checking if `arr` can be formed from `pieces`.
