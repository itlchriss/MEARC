Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `candidates` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `candidates` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 30.
- All values in the integer array parameter `candidates` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 200.
- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- The result is a list of lists of integers representing unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`.
- The result list may contain up to 150 unique combinations for the given input.
- The same number from `candidates` can be chosen an unlimited number of times in a combination.
- Two combinations are considered unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
