Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `coins` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `amount` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- The integer result is a list of lists where each inner list represents a unique combination of integers from the `coins` array that sum up to the `amount`.
- Each combination in the result list is unique, meaning the frequency of at least one chosen number is different.
- The number of unique combinations in the result list is less than 150 for the given input.
- The order of combinations in the result list can be arbitrary.
