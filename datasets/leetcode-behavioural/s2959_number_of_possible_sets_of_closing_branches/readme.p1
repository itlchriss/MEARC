Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10.
- The integer parameter `maxDistance` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `roads` is less than or equal to 1000.
- Each sub-array in the 2D integer array parameter `roads` has a length of 3.
- The first and second elements in each sub-array of the 2D integer array parameter `roads` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than `n`.
- The first and second elements in each sub-array of the 2D integer array parameter `roads` are not equal.
- The third element in each sub-array of the 2D integer array parameter `roads` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.
- The integer result is the number of possible sets of closing branches, so that any branch has a distance of at most `maxDistance` from any other.
