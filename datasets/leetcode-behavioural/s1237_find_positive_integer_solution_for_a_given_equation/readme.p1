Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `z` is greater than 0.
- The method `findSolution` must return a list of lists containing positive integer pairs `x` and `y` where `customfunction.f(x, y) == z`.
- The function `customfunction.f(x, y)` is monotonically increasing.
- The judge will provide a `function_id` to determine which implementation of `CustomFunction` to test the code with.
- The judge will compare the results of the `findSolution` method with the answer key generated for the specific `z`.
- The solution will be considered correct if the results match the answer key.
