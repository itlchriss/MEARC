Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `z` is the target value that the function `f(x, y)` should equal to.
- The function `f(x, y)` is monotonically increasing, meaning `f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)` and `f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)`.
- The method `findSolution` should return a list of lists, where each inner list contains two positive integers `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `f(x, y) == z`.
- The order of the pairs in the output list does not matter.
