- The integer 2D array parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum distance of a water cell to the nearest land cell in the integer 2D array `grid`.
- If no land or water exists in the grid, the integer result is -1.
- The Manhattan distance is used to calculate the distance between two cells in the grid.
- The distance between two cells `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1)` is `|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|`.
- The integer result is the maximum distance achievable in the grid.
