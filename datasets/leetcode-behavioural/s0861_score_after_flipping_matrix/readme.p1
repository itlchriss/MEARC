- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must have a length `m` and each row must have a length `n`.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must consist of only 0s and 1s.
- The integer result is the highest possible score of the matrix after making any number of moves.
- The highest possible score is calculated by interpreting each row of the matrix as a binary number and summing these numbers.
- A move consists of toggling each value in a row or column (changing all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s).
- The highest possible score is returned after applying any number of moves, including zero moves.
