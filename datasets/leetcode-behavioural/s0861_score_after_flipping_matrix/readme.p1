- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must have a length `m` and each row must have a length `n`.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must consist of only 0s and 1s.
- The integer result is the highest possible score of the matrix after making any number of moves.
- A move consists of toggling each value in a row or column (changing all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s).
- The score of the matrix is the sum of binary numbers interpreted from each row.
- The highest possible score is achieved by maximizing the binary numbers in each row.
- The output format should be a list with '-' as bullets.
