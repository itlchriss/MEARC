Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `img` must not be null.
- The integer matrix result has the same dimensions as the integer matrix parameter `img`.
- For each cell in the integer matrix result, the value is the floor of the average of the cell and its surrounding cells.
- If a surrounding cell is not present (i.e., out of bounds), it is not considered in the average calculation.
