Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must not be null.
- The integer matrix result has the same dimensions as the integer matrix parameter `matrix`.
- For each cell in the integer matrix result, the value is the floor of the average of the cell and its surrounding cells, considering only the cells that are present.
