- The string parameter `str1` and the string parameter `str2` are both subsequences of the string result.
- The string result is the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences.
- The string result may contain characters other than those in `str1` and `str2`.
- The length of the string result is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
- The string result may contain characters in any order as long as `str1` and `str2` are subsequences.
- If there are multiple valid strings that satisfy the above conditions, any of them can be returned.
