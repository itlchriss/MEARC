Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer 2D array parameter `triplets` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- Each triplet in the integer 2D array parameter `triplets` must have a length of 3.
- The integer array parameter `target` must have a length of 3.
- The integer result is true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, otherwise false.
- To obtain the target triplet [x, y, z], the operation of updating triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)] can be applied any number of times (possibly zero).
- The indices i and j chosen for the update operation must be different (i != j).
- The updated triplet [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)] is added to triplets.
- The target triplet [x, y, z] must be an element of triplets after applying the update operation.
