- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- All values in the 2D integer array parameter `grid` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 4.
- The integer result is the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
- The minimum cost is calculated by modifying the sign on a cell with a cost of 1, and this modification can only be done once.
