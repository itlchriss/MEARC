- The integer parameters `ax1`, `ay1`, `ax2`, `ay2`, `bx1`, `by1`, `bx2`, and `by2` must be within the range of -10000 to 10000.
- The integer result is the total area covered by the two rectangles.
- The total area covered by the two rectangles is calculated by finding the area of each rectangle and subtracting the overlapping area (if any).
- The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the difference between the x-coordinates by the difference between the y-coordinates.
- The overlapping area of the two rectangles is calculated by finding the intersection of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates and multiplying the differences of those intersections.
- If there is no overlap between the two rectangles, the total area is the sum of the areas of the two rectangles.
