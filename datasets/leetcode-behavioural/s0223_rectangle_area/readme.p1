- The integer parameters `ax1`, `ay1`, `ax2`, `ay2`, `bx1`, `by1`, `bx2`, and `by2` must be within the range of -10000 to 10000.
- The integer result is the total area covered by the two rectangles.
- The total area covered by the two rectangles is the sum of the areas of the individual rectangles minus the overlapping area.
- The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the difference between the x-coordinates of the top-right and bottom-left corners by the difference between the y-coordinates of the top-right and bottom-left corners.
- The overlapping area of the two rectangles is calculated by finding the intersection of the x and y ranges of the two rectangles and then calculating the area of the intersected rectangle.
- The overlapping area is subtracted from the sum of the areas of the individual rectangles to get the total area covered by the two rectangles.
