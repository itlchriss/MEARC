- The string parameter `binary` consists of only '0's or '1's.
- The string result is the maximum binary string that can be obtained after any number of operations.
- The decimal representation of the resulting binary string is greater than the decimal representation of the input binary string.
- The length of the resulting binary string is equal to the length of the input binary string.
- The resulting binary string cannot be transformed any further if it is already in its maximum form.
