- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- The length of the integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is equal to `n`.
- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` contain elements that are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the maximum possible score obtained by either swapping or not swapping subarrays between `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The maximum possible score is the maximum of the sum of elements in `nums1` and the sum of elements in `nums2`.
