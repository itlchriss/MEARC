- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have the same length `n`.
- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must contain elements greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the maximum possible score obtained by either swapping a subarray between `nums1` and `nums2` or not swapping at all.
- The maximum possible score is the maximum of the sum of elements in `nums1` and the sum of elements in `nums2`.
- The subarray to be swapped is defined by the indices `left` and `right` where `0 <= left <= right < n`.
- The subarray swap operation can be applied once or not at all.
- The subarray swap operation involves swapping the elements in the subarray `nums1[left...right]` with the elements in the subarray `nums2[left...right]`.
- The score calculation involves summing all elements in the resulting arrays after the swap operation.
- The resulting arrays after the swap operation are used to calculate the maximum possible score.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in `nums1` and is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in `nums2`.
