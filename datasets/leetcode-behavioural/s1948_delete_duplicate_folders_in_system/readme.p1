- The input parameter `paths` is a 2D list where each element `paths[i]` represents an absolute path to the i-th folder in the file system.
- Each path in the input list `paths` consists of lowercase English letters.
- The output is a 2D list `ans` containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders.
- The paths in the output list `ans` may be returned in any order.
- Folders are considered identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure.
- If two or more folders are identical, mark the folders as well as all their subfolders for deletion.
- The file system will delete all marked folders and their subfolders.
- The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.
