- The input parameter `paths` is a 2D array where each element `paths[i]` represents an absolute path to the i-th folder in the file system.
- The output is a 2D array `ans` containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders.
- Folders are considered identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure.
- Identical folders and their subfolders are marked for deletion and will be deleted from the file system.
- The file system will only run the deletion process once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.
- The order of paths in the output array `ans` does not matter.
