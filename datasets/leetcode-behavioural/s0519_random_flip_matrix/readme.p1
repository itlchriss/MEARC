- The integer parameter `nRows` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer parameter `nCols` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The method `flip()` returns a random index `[i, j]` of the matrix where `matrix[i][j] == 0` and flips it to `1`.
- All the indices `[i, j]` where `matrix[i][j] == 0` should be equally likely to be returned by the `flip()` method.
- The method `reset()` resets all the values of the matrix to be `0`.
