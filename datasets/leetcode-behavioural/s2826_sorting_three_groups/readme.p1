Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer list parameter `nums` contains elements from 1 to 3.
- The integer list parameter `nums` has a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to make the array `res` sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The array `res` is constructed by sorting the numbers in each group independently and appending the elements of groups 1, 2, and 3 in that order.
- The operation involves changing the group of a number by changing `nums[x]` to any number from 1 to 3.
- The array `res` is considered sorted in non-decreasing order if the elements are arranged in increasing order.
