Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500.
- The integer array parameter `languages` must have a length `m` where `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 500.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `languages` must be a set of unique integers ranging from 1 to `n`.
- The integer array parameter `friendships` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 500.
- Each tuple in the integer array parameter `friendships` must consist of two unique integers `u_i` and `v_i` where `1 <= u_i < v_i <= languages.length`.
- The integer result is the minimum number of users needed to teach a common language so that all friends can communicate with each other.
