- The integer array parameter `nums` contains elements where every element appears three times except for one element which appears exactly once.
- The integer result is the single element that appears exactly once in the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The integer result must be found with linear runtime complexity.
- The solution must use only constant extra space.
