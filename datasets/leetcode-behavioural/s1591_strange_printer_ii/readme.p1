- The boolean result is true if it is possible to print the matrix `targetGrid`.
- The boolean result is false if it is impossible to form `targetGrid` because it is not allowed to print the same color in different turns.
- The integer matrix parameter `targetGrid` must have dimensions `m x n` where `m` and `n` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 60.
- All values in the integer matrix parameter `targetGrid` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 60.
