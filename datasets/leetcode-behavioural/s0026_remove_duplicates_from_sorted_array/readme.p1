- The integer array parameter `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The integer result is equal to `k`, which represents the number of unique elements in the array after removing duplicates.
- The first `k` elements of the integer array `nums` hold the final result with each unique element appearing only once.
- The relative order of the elements in the array is kept the same.
- The length of the integer array `nums` does not change, and any elements beyond the first `k` elements are not specified.
- The method must modify the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
