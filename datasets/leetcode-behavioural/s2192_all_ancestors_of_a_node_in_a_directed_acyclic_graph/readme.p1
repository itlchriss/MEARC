Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is less than or equal to the minimum of 2000 and `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The values in each element of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to `n - 1`.
- The values in each element of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` are not equal to each other.
- There are no duplicate edges in the graph.
- The graph is directed and acyclic.
- The integer list result `answer` contains lists of ancestors for each node, sorted in ascending order.
