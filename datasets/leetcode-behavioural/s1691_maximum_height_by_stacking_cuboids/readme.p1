- The integer parameter `arr` is a 2D array representing `n` cuboids, where each cuboid is represented as an array of three integers `[width, length, height]`.
- The integer result is the maximum height achievable by stacking the cuboids on each other.
- Each cuboid can be placed on another cuboid if its width, length, and height are less than or equal to the width, length, and height of the other cuboid.
- Cuboids can be rearranged by rotating them to fit on top of each other.
- The total height is calculated by summing the heights of the stacked cuboids.
- The maximum height of the stacked cuboids should be returned as the integer result.
