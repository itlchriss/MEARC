- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -1000000000 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameters `lower` and `upper` are greater than or equal to -1000000000 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The long result is the number of fair pairs where a fair pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that 0 <= i < j < n and lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper.
