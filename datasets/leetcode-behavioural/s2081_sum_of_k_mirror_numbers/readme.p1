- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 9.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 30.
- The long result is the sum of the `n` smallest k-mirror numbers.
- The k-mirror numbers are positive integers without leading zeros that read the same both forward and backward in base-10 as well as in base-k.
- The k-mirror numbers are determined based on the given base `k` and the number `n`.
- The k-mirror numbers are calculated by finding positive integers that read the same both forward and backward in base-10 and base-k.
- The k-mirror numbers are sorted in ascending order, and the sum of the `n` smallest k-mirror numbers is returned as the result.
