- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 9.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 30.
- The long result is the sum of the `n` smallest k-mirror numbers.
- The k-mirror numbers are positive integers without leading zeros that read the same both forward and backward in base-10 as well as in base-k.
- The k-mirror numbers are represented in base-10 and base-k.
- The k-mirror numbers are the `n` smallest numbers that satisfy the k-mirror property.
- The sum of the k-mirror numbers is calculated by adding up the values of the `n` smallest k-mirror numbers.
