- The integer array parameter `prices` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `prices`.
- For each element in the integer array parameter `prices`, if there exists an element with a lower price and a higher index, the final price is calculated by subtracting the lower price from the current price.
- If there is no element with a lower price and a higher index, the final price remains the same as the current price.
