- The integer array parameter `prices` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `prices`.
- For each element in the integer array parameter `prices`, if there exists an element at a higher index with a value less than or equal to the current element, the final price is calculated by subtracting the value of the element at the higher index from the current element.
- If there is no element at a higher index with a value less than or equal to the current element, the final price remains the same as the current element.
- The final price for each item is stored in the corresponding index of the integer array result.
