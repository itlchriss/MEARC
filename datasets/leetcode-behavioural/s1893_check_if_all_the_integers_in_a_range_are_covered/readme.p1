- If each integer in the inclusive range `[left, right]` is covered by at least one interval in the 2D integer array parameter `ranges`, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
- If any integer in the inclusive range `[left, right]` is not covered by any interval in the 2D integer array parameter `ranges`, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
- Each integer `x` in the inclusive range `[left, right]` is covered by an interval `[start, end]` if `start <= x <= end`.
- The integer array parameter `ranges` has a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- Each interval `[start, end]` in the 2D integer array parameter `ranges` has `start` greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50, and `end` greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to 50.
- The integer parameters `left` and `right` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50.
