Method behavioural requirements:
- For each integer `x` in the inclusive range `[left, right]`, there must exist at least one interval in the 2D integer array parameter `ranges` such that `start_i <= x <= end_i`.
- If every integer in the inclusive range `[left, right]` is covered by at least one interval in the 2D integer array parameter `ranges`, the boolean result is true.
- If there exists an integer in the inclusive range `[left, right]` that is not covered by any interval in the 2D integer array parameter `ranges`, the boolean result is false.
