Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a 0-indexed binary matrix.
- The integer list result contains row indices of a good subset sorted in ascending order.
- A good subset of rows is defined as a non-empty subset where the sum of each column is at most half of the length of the subset.
- If there are multiple good subsets, any of them can be returned.
- If there are no good subsets, an empty list is returned.
