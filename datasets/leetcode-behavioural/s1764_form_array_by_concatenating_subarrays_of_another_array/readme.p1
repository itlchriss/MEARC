- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if it is possible to choose `n` disjoint subarrays from the array `nums` such that the `i-th` subarray is equal to `groups[i]` and if `i > 0`, the `(i-1)-th` subarray appears before the `i-th` subarray in `nums`.
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if it is not possible to choose `n` disjoint subarrays from the array `nums` as specified above.
