- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer parameter `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- If it is possible to reduce `x` to exactly 0, the integer result is the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.
- If it is not possible to reduce `x` to exactly 0, the integer result is -1.
