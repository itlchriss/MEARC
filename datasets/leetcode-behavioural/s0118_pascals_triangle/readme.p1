- The integer parameter `numRows` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30.
- The result is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row of Pascal's triangle.
- Each inner list in the result contains integers that are the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.
- The number of inner lists in the result is equal to the integer parameter `numRows`.
- The first inner list in the result contains the integer 1.
- The second inner list in the result contains two integers, both equal to 1.
- Each subsequent inner list in the result contains integers that are the sum of the two adjacent numbers in the previous row, with 1 as the first and last element.
