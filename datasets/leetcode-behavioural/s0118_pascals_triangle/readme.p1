- The integer parameter `numRows` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 30.
- The result is a list of lists representing the first `numRows` rows of Pascal's triangle.
- Each inner list in the result represents a row of Pascal's triangle.
- Each number in the inner lists is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the row.
- The first element of each row is always 1.
- The last element of each row is always 1.
- The length of each inner list in the result corresponds to the row number it represents.
