- The string parameter `s` is partitioned into groups of size `k`.
- Each group consists of `k` characters from the string `s`, except for the last group which may contain less than `k` characters.
- If the last group does not have `k` characters remaining, the character `fill` is used to complete the group.
- The resultant string array denotes the composition of every group `s` has been divided into.
- The length of the string array result is equal to the number of groups formed.
- Each element in the string array result represents a group formed from the string `s`.
- The characters in each group are in the same order as they appear in the original string `s`.
- The character `fill` is only used to complete the last group if needed.
- The constraints for the input parameters `s`, `k`, and `fill` are strictly adhered to.
