- The integer 2D-array parameter `edges` represents a directed graph where each element is a pair [ui, vi] indicating a directed edge from node ui to node vi.
- The integer array result is an edge [u, v] that can be removed from the graph to make it a rooted tree of n nodes.
- If there are multiple edges that can be removed, the result should be the edge that occurs last in the given 2D-array `edges`.
