- The integer array parameter `edges` represents a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with `n` nodes.
- Each element in the integer 2D-array parameter `edges` is a pair `[u_i, v_i]` that represents a directed edge connecting nodes `u_i` and `v_i`, where `u_i` is a parent of child `v_i`.
- The integer array result is an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of `n` nodes.
- If there are multiple answers, the result should be the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array parameter `edges`.
- The integer array result has a length of 2.
- All values in the integer array result are unique.
