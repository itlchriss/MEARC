Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `relations` is less than or equal to the minimum of n * (n - 1) / 2 and 50000.
- Each pair [prevCourse, nextCourse] in the 2D integer array parameter `relations` has two elements where both elements are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, and the two elements are not equal.
- All pairs [prevCourse, nextCourse] in the 2D integer array parameter `relations` are unique.
- The length of the integer array parameter `time` is equal to n.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `time` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The directed graph formed by the relations is acyclic.
- The integer result is the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses.
