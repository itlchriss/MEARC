Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `bound` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100.
- The integer list result contains all powerful integers that can be represented as x^i + y^j for some integers i >= 0 and j >= 0.
- Each value in the integer list result occurs at most once.
- The values in the integer list result are less than or equal to the integer parameter `bound`.
