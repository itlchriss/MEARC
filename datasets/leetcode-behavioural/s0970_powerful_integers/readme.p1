- The integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `bound` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer result is a list of powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to the integer parameter `bound`.
- Each powerful integer in the result list can be represented as x^i + y^j for some integers i >= 0 and j >= 0.
- Each value in the result list should occur at most once.
