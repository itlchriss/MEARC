- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of the integer parameter `n`.
- The integer result is equal to 0 if there are no trailing zeroes in the factorial of the integer parameter `n`.
- The integer result is greater than 0 if there are trailing zeroes in the factorial of the integer parameter `n`.
- The solution should work in logarithmic time complexity.
