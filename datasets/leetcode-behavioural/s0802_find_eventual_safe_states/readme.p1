- The integer 2D array parameter `graph` must not be null.
- The integer 2D array parameter `graph` must be 0-indexed.
- The integer 2D array parameter `graph` represents a directed graph where `graph[i]` is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node `i`.
- A node is considered a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges from that node.
- A node is considered a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.
- The result is a list containing all safe nodes of the graph.
- The result list should be sorted in ascending order.
