- The integer array parameter `graph` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `graph` is a 2D array representing a directed graph where `graph[i]` is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node `i`.
- The integer array parameter `graph` is 0-indexed.
- The integer array parameter `graph` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- The integer result is a list containing all the safe nodes of the graph.
- The list of safe nodes should be sorted in ascending order.
- A node is considered a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges from that node.
- A node is considered a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.
