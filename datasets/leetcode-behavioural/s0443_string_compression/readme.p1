- For each group of consecutive repeating characters in the input character array `chars`:
    - If the group's length is 1, the character remains uncompressed.
    - If the group's length is greater than 1, the character is followed by the group's length.
- The compressed string should be stored in the input character array `chars`.
- Group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.
- The method should return the new length of the input array after compression.
- The algorithm should use only constant extra space.
