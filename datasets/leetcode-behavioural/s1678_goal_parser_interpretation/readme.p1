- The string parameter `command` consists of characters `"G"`, `"()"`, and/or `"(al)"`.
- The string result is the concatenation of the interpreted strings based on the following rules:
    - `"G"` is interpreted as the string `"G"`.
    - `"()"` is interpreted as the string `"o"`.
    - `"(al)"` is interpreted as the string `"al"`.
- The final concatenated result is returned as the string result.
