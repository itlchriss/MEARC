- The string parameter `command` consists of characters `"G"`, `"()"`, and/or `"(al)"`.
- The string result is the concatenation of the interpreted strings based on the following rules:
    - The character `"G"` is interpreted as the string `"G"`.
    - The substring `"()"` is interpreted as the string `"o"`.
    - The substring `"(al)"` is interpreted as the string `"al"`.
- The final concatenated result is the interpretation of the `command` string.
