- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to transform the integer parameter `n` into 0.
- The binary representation of the integer parameter `n` is used to determine the operations.
- The operations involve changing the rightmost bit and other bits based on specific conditions.
- The operations are applied any number of times until the integer parameter `n` is transformed into 0.
