- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is equal to the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` that are not divisible by `m` minus the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` that are divisible by `m`.
