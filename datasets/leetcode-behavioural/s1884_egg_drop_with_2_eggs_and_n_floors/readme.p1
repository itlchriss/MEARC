- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves needed to determine the value of `f` with certainty.
- The method must follow the optimal strategy described in the examples to determine the value of `f`.
- The method must handle the scenario where both eggs break, one egg breaks, or neither egg breaks appropriately to determine the value of `f`.
- The method must drop the eggs strategically to minimize the number of moves needed to determine the value of `f`.
