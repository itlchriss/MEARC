- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves needed to determine the value of `f` with certainty.
- The minimum number of moves is achieved by dropping the first egg at specific floors and then using the second egg to find the floor `f`.
- If the first egg breaks at a certain floor, the value of `f` is determined to be below that floor.
- If the first egg does not break at a certain floor, the value of `f` is determined to be above that floor.
- The process of dropping the eggs is optimized to minimize the number of moves required to determine `f`.
