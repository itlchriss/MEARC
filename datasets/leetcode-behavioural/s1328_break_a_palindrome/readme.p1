- The string parameter `palindrome` must be a palindromic string of lowercase English letters.
- The string result is the lexicographically smallest string that is not a palindrome and is obtained by replacing exactly one character in the input string `palindrome`.
- If there is no way to replace a character to make the string not a palindrome, the result is an empty string.
