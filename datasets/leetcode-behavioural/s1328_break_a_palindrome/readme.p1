- If the string parameter `palindrome` is a palindrome with length greater than 1, the resulting string must be lexicographically smallest possible by replacing exactly one character with any lowercase English letter.
- If there is no way to replace a character to make the string parameter `palindrome` not a palindrome, the resulting string is an empty string.
