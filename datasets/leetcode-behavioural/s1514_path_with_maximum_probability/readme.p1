- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer parameters `start` and `end` are both greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`.
- The integer parameters `start` and `end` are not equal.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 20000.
- The length of the double array parameter `succProb` is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `edges`.
- The double values in the `succProb` array are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.
- There is at most one edge between every two nodes.
- The double result is the maximum probability of success to go from the `start` node to the `end` node.
- If there is no path from `start` to `end`, the double result is equal to 0.
- The difference between the calculated result and the correct answer should be at most 1e-5.
