- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer parameters `start` and `end` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than `n`.
- The integer parameters `start` and `end` are not equal.
- The integer parameters `a` and `b` in the edge list are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than `n`.
- The integer parameters `a` and `b` in the edge list are not equal.
- The double array `succProb` length is equal to the edge list length and is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1.
- There is at most one edge between every two nodes.
- The double result is the maximum probability of success to go from the `start` node to the `end` node.
- If there is no path from `start` to `end`, the double result is 0.
- The difference between the result and the correct answer should be at most 1e-5.
