Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` is 0-indexed.
- The integer result is the number of square-free non-empty subsets of the array `nums`.
- The integer result is modulo 10^9 + 7.
- A square-free subset is a subset of the array `nums` where the product of its elements is a square-free integer.
- A square-free integer is an integer that is divisible by no square number other than 1.
- A non-empty subset of `nums` is an array obtained by deleting some (possibly none but not all) elements from `nums`.
- Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.
