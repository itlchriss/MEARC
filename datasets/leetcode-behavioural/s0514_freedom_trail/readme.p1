- The integer result is the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the string `key`.
- The string parameter `ring` and `key` consist of only lower case English letters.
- The length of the string parameters `ring` and `key` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The character in the string parameter `key` must be aligned at the "12:00" direction by rotating the string parameter `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise.
- Each rotation of the string parameter `ring` counts as one step.
- Pressing the center button to spell a character also counts as one step.
- The character in the string parameter `key` must be aligned at the "12:00" direction before pressing the center button.
- The final output is the total number of steps required to spell all characters in the string `key`.
