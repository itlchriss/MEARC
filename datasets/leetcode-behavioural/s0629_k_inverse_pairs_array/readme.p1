- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the number of different arrays consisting of numbers from 1 to `n` such that there are exactly `k` inverse pairs.
- The result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
