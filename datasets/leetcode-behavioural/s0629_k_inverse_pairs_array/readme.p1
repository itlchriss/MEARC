Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the number of different arrays consisting of numbers from 1 to `n` with exactly `k` inverse pairs.
- The integer result must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
