- The integer array parameter `nums` contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
- The integer parameter `target` is within the range of -10^4 to 10^4.
- The integer result is the index where the `target` is found in the `nums` array.
- If the `target` is not found in the `nums` array, the result is the index where the `target` would be inserted in order.
- The algorithm must have O(log n) runtime complexity.
