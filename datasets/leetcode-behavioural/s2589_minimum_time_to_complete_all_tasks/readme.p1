- The integer 2D array parameter `tasks` must not be null.
- The length of the integer 2D array parameter `tasks` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 2000.
- Each sub-array in the integer 2D array parameter `tasks` has a length of 3.
- The integer parameters `start`, `end`, and `duration` in each sub-array satisfy the constraints: 1 <= start_i, end_i <= 2000 and 1 <= duration_i <= end_i - start_i + 1.
- The integer result is the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks.
