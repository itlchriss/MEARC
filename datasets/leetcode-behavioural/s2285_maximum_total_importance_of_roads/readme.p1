- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 50000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `roads` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50000.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `roads` has a length of 2.
- The values in each element of the 2D integer array parameter `roads` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to `n - 1`.
- The values in each element of the 2D integer array parameter `roads` are not equal to each other.
- The integer result is the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.
