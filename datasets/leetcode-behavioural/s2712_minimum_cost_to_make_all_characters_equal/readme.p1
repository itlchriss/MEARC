- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The binary string parameter `s` has a length equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- The string parameter `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters.
- The long result is the minimum cost to make all characters of the string `s` equal.
- The minimum cost is calculated by applying the two types of operations described in the business requirement.
- The cost of inverting characters at index `i` is `i + 1` for the first type of operation and `n - i` for the second type of operation.
