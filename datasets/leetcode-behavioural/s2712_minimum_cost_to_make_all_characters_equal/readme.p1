- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The string parameter `s` is a binary string of length `n`.
- The long result is the minimum cost to make all characters of the string `s` equal.
- The cost of inverting all characters from index `0` to index `i` is `i + 1`.
- The cost of inverting all characters from index `i` to index `n - 1` is `n - i`.
