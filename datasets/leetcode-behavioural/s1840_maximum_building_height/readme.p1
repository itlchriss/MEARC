- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The 2D integer array parameter `restrictions` has a length that is less than or equal to the minimum of `n - 1` and 10^5.
- Each sub-array in the 2D integer array `restrictions` has two elements where the first element `id_i` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to `n`, and the second element `maxHeight_i` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The height of the first building is 0.
- The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed 1.
- The maximum height of each building specified in the `restrictions` array must be adhered to.
- The output integer result is the maximum possible height of the tallest building that can be built while satisfying all the city restrictions.
