- The string parameter `order` contains unique characters that represent the custom sorting order.
- The string parameter `s` contains characters that need to be permuted to match the custom sorting order specified in the `order` string.
- The string result is a permutation of the characters in the `s` string that satisfies the custom sorting order specified in the `order` string.
- If a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in the `order` string, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.
- Characters in the `s` string that do not appear in the `order` string can be placed at any position in the returned string.
- The length of the returned string is equal to the length of the `s` string.
- The characters in the returned string are a permutation of the characters in the `s` string that satisfies the custom sorting order specified in the `order` string.
