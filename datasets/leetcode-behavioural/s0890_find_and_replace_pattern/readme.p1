- For each string in the `words` list, if there exists a permutation of letters `p` such that after replacing every letter `x` in the `pattern` with `p(x)`, the string matches the pattern, it should be included in the output list.
- The output list may contain the strings in any order.
- The length of the `pattern` string is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20.
- The length of each string in the `words` list is equal to the length of the `pattern` string.
- The `pattern` string and all strings in the `words` list consist of lowercase English letters.
