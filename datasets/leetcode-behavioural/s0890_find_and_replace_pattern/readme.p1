- For each string in the string array parameter `words`, if there exists a permutation of letters such that after replacing every letter in the string with the corresponding letter from the permutation, the resulting string matches the string parameter `pattern`, that string is included in the output list.
- The output list may contain strings in any order.
- The output list only includes strings that match the pattern based on the defined permutation of letters.
