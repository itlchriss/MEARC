- The string parameter `n` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 18.
- The string parameter `n` consists of only digits.
- The string parameter `n` does not have leading zeros.
- The string parameter `n` represents an integer in the range [1, 10^18 - 1].
- The string result is the closest integer (not including itself) to the string parameter `n`, which is a palindrome.
- If there is a tie, the string result is the smaller one.
- The closest integer is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.
