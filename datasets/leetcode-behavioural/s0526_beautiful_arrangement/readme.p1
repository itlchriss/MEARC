- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 15.
- The integer result is the number of beautiful arrangements that can be constructed for the given `n`.
- A permutation of the `n` integers is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every `i` (1 <= i <= n), either `perm[i]` is divisible by `i` or `i` is divisible by `perm[i]`.
