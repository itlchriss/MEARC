- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array `nums`.
- The integer result is the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of the integer array `nums` such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied.
