Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `arr` contains unique integers from 1 to the length of `arr`.
- The length of the integer array parameter `arr` is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer array result is a list of `k` values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort the `arr`.
- Each `k` value in the integer array result is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of `arr`.
- The number of pancake flips performed to sort the `arr` is within 10 times the length of `arr`.
