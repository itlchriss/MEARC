- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The integer parameters `t` and `target` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 50.
- The double result is the probability that after `t` seconds the frog is on the vertex `target`.
