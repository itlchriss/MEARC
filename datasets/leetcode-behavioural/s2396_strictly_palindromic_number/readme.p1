- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if the integer parameter `n` is strictly palindromic, and false otherwise.
- For every base `b` between 2 and `n - 2` (inclusive), the string representation of the integer `n` in base `b` must be palindromic for `n` to be considered strictly palindromic.
