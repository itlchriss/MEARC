- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 30.
- The integer result is the Fibonacci number `F(n)` calculated based on the Fibonacci sequence formula.
- The Fibonacci number `F(n)` is the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers `F(n-1)` and `F(n-2)`.
- The Fibonacci number `F(0)` is 0 and the Fibonacci number `F(1)` is 1.
- The Fibonacci number `F(n)` is calculated recursively for `n > 1`.
