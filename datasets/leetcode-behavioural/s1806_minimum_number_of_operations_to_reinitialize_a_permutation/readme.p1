- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the minimum non-zero number of operations needed to perform on the permutation `perm` to return it to its initial value.
- The permutation `perm` is initially a permutation of size `n` where `perm[i] == i` (0-indexed).
- In each operation, a new array `arr` is created based on specific rules for each index `i`.
- For even indices `i`, `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]`.
- For odd indices `i`, `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]`.
- The array `arr` is then assigned to `perm`.
- The output should be the minimum number of operations required to return `perm` to its initial value.
