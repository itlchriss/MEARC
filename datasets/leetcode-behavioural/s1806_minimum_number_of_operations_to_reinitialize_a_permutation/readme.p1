- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `n` is an even number.
- The integer result is the minimum non-zero number of operations needed to perform on the permutation `perm` to return it to its initial value.
- The permutation `perm` is initially a permutation of size `n` where `perm[i] == i` (0-indexed).
- In each operation, a new array `arr` is created based on specific rules for each index `i`.
- For each index `i`, if `i % 2 == 0`, then `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]`.
- For each index `i`, if `i % 2 == 1`, then `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]`.
- The array `arr` is then assigned back to `perm`.
- The number of operations needed is the minimum number of operations required to return the permutation `perm` to its initial value.
