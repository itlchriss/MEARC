- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to -1000000 and less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer result is the maximum score achievable by rearranging the elements of the integer array `nums`.
- The maximum score is the number of positive integers in the array `prefix` after rearranging `nums`.
- The array `prefix` contains the prefix sums of `nums` after rearranging it.
- The array `prefix` is calculated by summing the elements from index 0 to index `i` in `nums` after rearranging it.
- The maximum score is the maximum number of positive integers in the array `prefix` that can be achieved by rearranging `nums`.
