- The string parameter `s` must not be null.
- The integer result is the number of good splits that can be made in the string `s`.
- A split is considered good if the string `s` can be split into two non-empty strings `s_left` and `s_right` where their concatenation is equal to `s` and the number of distinct letters in `s_left` and `s_right` is the same.
