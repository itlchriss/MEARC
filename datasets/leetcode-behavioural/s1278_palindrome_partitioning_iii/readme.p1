- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the string `s`.
- The string parameter `s` only contains lowercase English letters.
- The integer result is the minimal number of characters that need to be changed to divide the string `s` into `k` non-empty disjoint substrings, each of which is a palindrome.
