- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than the length of the integer array `nums`.
- The integer result is the maximum possible score of a good subarray.
- The maximum possible score of a good subarray is defined as the minimum value in the subarray from index `i` to index `j` multiplied by the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1)`.
- A good subarray is a subarray where the starting index `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the ending index `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
