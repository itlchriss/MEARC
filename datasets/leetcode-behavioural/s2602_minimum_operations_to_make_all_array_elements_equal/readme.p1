Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` consists of positive integers.
- The integer array parameter `queries` has a size of `m`.
- For each query in the integer array parameter `queries`, the minimum number of operations to make all elements of `nums` equal to the query value is calculated.
- The operation can be either increasing or decreasing an element of the array by 1.
- After each query, the array `nums` is reset to its original state.
- The total number of operations for each query is calculated by the sum of individual operations needed to make all elements equal to the query value.
- The output is a list of `m` long integers, where each element represents the minimum number of operations for the corresponding query in the `queries` array.
