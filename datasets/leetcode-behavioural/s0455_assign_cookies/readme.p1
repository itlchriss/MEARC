- For each child `i` with greed factor `g[i]` and each cookie `j` with size `s[j]`, if `s[j] >= g[i]`, assign the cookie `j` to the child `i` to make the child content.
- The integer array parameter `g` represents the greed factors of the children.
- The integer array parameter `s` represents the sizes of the cookies.
- The integer result is the maximum number of content children that can be achieved by assigning cookies based on the given conditions.
