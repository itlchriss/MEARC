- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must be of the same length `n`.
- All values in the integer array parameters `nums1` and `nums2` are unique and within the range from 0 to n-1.
- The integer result is the total number of good triplets present in the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- A good triplet is defined as a set of 3 distinct values in increasing order by position in both `nums1` and `nums2`.
- For a good triplet (x, y, z), the indices pos1_x < pos1_y < pos1_z and pos2_x < pos2_y < pos2_z must hold true.
- The output must be a long data type to accommodate large numbers of good triplets.
- The method signature must be public and return a long data type.
- The method name should be descriptive such as `goodTriplets`.
- The method should not contain any implementation details or algorithm descriptions, only the behavioural specifications.
