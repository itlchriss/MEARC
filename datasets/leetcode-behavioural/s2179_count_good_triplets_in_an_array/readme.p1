- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must be of the same length.
- All values in the integer array parameters `nums1` and `nums2` are unique and within the range of 0 to n-1.
- The integer result is the total number of good triplets present in the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- A good triplet is defined as a set of 3 distinct values in increasing order by position in both `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The good triplet (x, y, z) must satisfy the conditions pos1_x < pos1_y < pos1_z and pos2_x < pos2_y < pos2_z.
- The integer result represents the count of such good triplets present in the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
