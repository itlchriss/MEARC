Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameters `rows` and `cols` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameters `rCenter` and `cCenter` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than the respective `rows` and `cols`.
- The integer array result contains coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from `(rCenter, cCenter)` from the smallest distance to the largest distance.
- The distance between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is calculated as `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.
- The order of the cells in the result array can be in any order as long as it satisfies the condition of being sorted by distance.
