- The integer parameter `id` represents the unique ID of a student.
- The integer parameter `points` represents the points of a student, which initially starts at 0.
- Each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by 3.
- Each negative word in a feedback report decreases the points of a student by 1.
- The method must rank the students in non-increasing order by their points.
- If more than one student has the same points, the student with the lower ID ranks higher.
- The method must return the top `k` students after ranking them.
