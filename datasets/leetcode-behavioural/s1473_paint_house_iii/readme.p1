- The integer array parameter `houses` must have a length equal to the integer parameter `m`.
- The integer matrix parameter `cost` must have a number of rows equal to the integer parameter `m` and a number of columns equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- The integer parameter `nColors` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20.
- The integer parameter `tGroups` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the integer parameter `m`.
- The integer result is the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly `tGroups` neighborhoods.
- If it is not possible to achieve exactly `tGroups` neighborhoods, the integer result is equal to -1.
