- The integer array parameter `houses` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `cost` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `nColors` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20.
- The integer parameter `tGroups` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `houses`.

- If it is not possible to achieve the target number of neighborhoods, the integer result is -1.
