- The integer matrix parameter `grid` is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise.
- The integer result is the number of negative numbers in the integer matrix parameter `grid`.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.
- The integer result is less than or equal to the total number of elements in the integer matrix parameter `grid`.
- The integer result is less than or equal to 100.
- The time complexity of the method is O(n + m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the integer matrix parameter `grid`.
