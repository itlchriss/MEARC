- The integer matrix parameter `points` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `points` must be a 2D array with dimensions `m x n`.
- The integer result is the maximum number of points that can be achieved by picking one cell in each row of the matrix.
- For every two adjacent rows `r` and `r + 1`, the points gained from picking cells at coordinates `(r, c1)` and `(r + 1, c2)` must be subtracted by `abs(c1 - c2)` from the score.
- The final score is the sum of points gained minus the sum of absolute differences between column coordinates of adjacent rows.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.
