- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must have the same length `n`.
- The integer result is the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in the array `nums1`.
- The integer result must be modulo 10^9 + 7.
- The absolute sum difference is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
- At most one element in `nums1` can be replaced with any other element in `nums1` to minimize the absolute sum difference.
- The absolute difference between two elements is calculated as `|x|` where `x` is the difference between the two elements.
- The output format should be a list with '-' as bullets.
