- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums2`.
- The integer result is the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in the array `nums1`.
- The integer result is modulo 10^9 + 7.
- The integer result is the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The replacement of an element in `nums1` can be done at most once.
- The absolute sum difference is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The absolute difference between two elements is defined as the absolute value of the subtraction of the two elements.
- The absolute value of a number `x` is `x` if `x >= 0`, and `-x` if `x < 0`.
