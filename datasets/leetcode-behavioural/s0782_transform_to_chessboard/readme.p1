- The integer 2D array parameter `board` must not be null.
- The integer 2D array parameter `board` must have a length `n` where `2 <= n <= 30`.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves to transform the `board` into a chessboard.
- If it is impossible to transform the `board` into a chessboard, the integer result is equal to -1.
