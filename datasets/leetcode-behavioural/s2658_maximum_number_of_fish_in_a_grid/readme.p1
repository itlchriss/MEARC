Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer 2D matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum number of fish the fisher can catch if he chooses his starting cell optimally.
- If no water cell exists in the grid, the integer result is equal to 0.
- The fisher can catch all the fish at a water cell and move to any adjacent water cell.
- An adjacent cell of the cell `(r, c)` is one of the cells `(r, c + 1)`, `(r, c - 1)`, `(r + 1, c)`, or `(r - 1, c)` if it exists.
