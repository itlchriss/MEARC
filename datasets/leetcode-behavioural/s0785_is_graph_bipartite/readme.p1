- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if the graph is bipartite, meaning the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge connects a node in set A and a node in set B.
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if there is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one set and a node in the other set.
- The integer 2D array parameter `graph` represents an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and `n - 1`.
- The integer 2D array parameter `graph` must not contain self-edges (each sub-array does not contain the index of its own node).
- The integer 2D array parameter `graph` must not contain parallel edges (each sub-array does not contain duplicate values).
- If node `v` is in the sub-array of node `u` in `graph`, then node `u` must be in the sub-array of node `v` in `graph` (the graph is undirected).
- The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.
