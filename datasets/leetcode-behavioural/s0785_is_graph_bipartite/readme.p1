- If the graph is bipartite, the boolean result is true.
- If the graph is not bipartite, the boolean result is false.
- The 2D array parameter `graph` represents an undirected graph with `n` nodes.
- Each node in the graph is numbered between 0 and `n - 1`.
- The array `graph[u]` for each node `u` contains nodes that node `u` is adjacent to.
- There are no self-edges in the graph.
- There are no parallel edges in the graph.
- If node `v` is in `graph[u]`, then node `u` is in `graph[v]`.
- The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be nodes `u` and `v` with no path between them.
