- The input parameter `box` must be a 2D character array representing a side-view of a box.
- The output result is an `n x m` matrix representing the box after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.
- Each cell in the output matrix can be one of the following characters: `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.
- Stones in the box fall due to gravity until they land on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.
- Gravity does not affect the positions of obstacles, and the rotation does not affect the horizontal positions of stones.
- The output matrix must have the dimensions `n x m`, where `n` is the number of columns in the input `box` and `m` is the number of rows in the input `box`.
- The output matrix must represent the box after the described rotation.
