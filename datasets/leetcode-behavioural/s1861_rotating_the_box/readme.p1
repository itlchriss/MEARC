- The input parameter `box` must be a 2D character array representing a side-view of a box.
- The output is an `n x m` matrix representing the box after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.
- Stones in the box fall down until they land on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.
- Gravity does not affect the obstacles' positions, and the rotation does not affect the stones' horizontal positions.
- The output matrix must have the same number of rows as the number of columns in the input matrix and vice versa.
- The output matrix must have the stones falling down according to the gravity rules.
- The output matrix must have the obstacles remain stationary.
- The output matrix must have the stones' horizontal positions unchanged after rotation.
- The output matrix must have the stones land on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.
- The output matrix must have the stones represented by `'#'`, obstacles by `'*'`, and empty spaces by `'.'`.
- The constraints for the input matrix dimensions are `1 <= m, n <= 500`.
- Each stone in the input matrix rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.
