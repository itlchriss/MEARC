- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the longest distance between any two adjacent `1`'s in the binary representation of the integer parameter `n`.
- If there are no two adjacent `1`'s in the binary representation of the integer parameter `n`, the integer result is 0.
