- The integer parameter `n` must be a positive integer.
- If there are no two adjacent `1`'s in the binary representation of the integer parameter `n`, the integer result is 0.
- If there are adjacent `1`'s in the binary representation of the integer parameter `n`, the integer result is the longest distance between any two adjacent `1`'s.
