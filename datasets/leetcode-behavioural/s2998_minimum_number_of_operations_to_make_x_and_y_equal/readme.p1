- The integer parameter `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer parameter `y` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to make `x` and `y` equal.
- The minimum number of operations is calculated based on the following rules:
    - If `x` is a multiple of 11, it can be divided by 11.
    - If `x` is a multiple of 5, it can be divided by 5.
    - `x` can be decremented by 1.
    - `x` can be incremented by 1.
