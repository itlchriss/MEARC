Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `edges` represents the network connections between servers, where each subarray [u, v] indicates a message channel between servers u and v.
- The integer array parameter `patience` represents the resend interval for each data server, where patience[i] indicates the number of seconds a data server i will wait before resending a message.
- The integer result is the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle.
- At the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to the master server for processing.
- Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server checks if it has received a reply to the message it sent from the master server.
- If a data server has not received a reply, it will resend the message periodically based on its patience value.
- If a data server has received a reply, no more resending will occur from that server.
- The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.
- The network becomes idle when all data servers have received replies to their messages and no more resending is required.
- The network becomes idle when there are no more messages in transit between servers.
- The network becomes idle when all messages have been processed and replied to by the master server.
