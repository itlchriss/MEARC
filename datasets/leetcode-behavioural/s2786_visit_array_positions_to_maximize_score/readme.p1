- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `x` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer result is the maximum total score that can be obtained by visiting positions in the array according to the given rules.
- The initial score is `nums[0]`.
- When moving from position `i` to position `j`, if the parities of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` differ, a score of `x` is deducted.
- The maximum total score is calculated by summing the values of the visited positions and deducting `x` for each move where the parities differ.
