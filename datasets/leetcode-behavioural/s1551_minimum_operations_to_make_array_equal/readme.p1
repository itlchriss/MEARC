- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of the array `arr` equal.
- The length of the array `arr` is equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- In each operation, two indices `x` and `y` are selected where `0 <= x, y < n`.
- In each operation, 1 is subtracted from `arr[x]` and 1 is added to `arr[y`.
- It is guaranteed that all elements of the array `arr` can be made equal using some operations.
