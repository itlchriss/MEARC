- The string parameters `left` and `right` must represent positive integers.
- The integer result is the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range `[left, right]`.
- A super-palindrome is a palindrome that is also the square of a palindrome.
- The result must be inclusive of the values of `left` and `right`.
- The result must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The result must be calculated efficiently for large integer ranges.
