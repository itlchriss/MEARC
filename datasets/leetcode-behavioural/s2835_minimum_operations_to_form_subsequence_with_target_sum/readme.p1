- The integer list parameter `nums` must be non-negative powers of 2.
- The integer parameter `target` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 2^31.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations needed to form a subsequence in `nums` whose elements sum to `target`.
- If it is impossible to obtain such a subsequence, the integer result is -1.
