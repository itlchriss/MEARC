- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 1000000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `cuts` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of `n - 1` and 100.
- All values in the integer array parameter `cuts` are distinct.
- The integer result is the minimum total cost of performing the cuts.
- The order of cuts can be changed.
- Performing a cut at position `cuts[i]` incurs a cost equal to the length of the stick to be cut.
- After each cut, the stick is split into two smaller sticks.
