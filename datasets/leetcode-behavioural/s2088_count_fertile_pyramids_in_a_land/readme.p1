- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `grid` is a 2D binary matrix with dimensions `m x n`.
- The integer result is the total number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots that can be found in the `grid`.
- A pyramidal plot is a set of fertile cells with an apex at the topmost cell and a height defined by the number of rows it covers.
- An inverse pyramidal plot is a set of fertile cells with an apex at the bottommost cell and a height defined by the number of rows it covers.
