Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must have a length `m` and each row must have a length `n`.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must consist of only 0s and 1s.
- The integer result is the total number of valid pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots in the `grid`.
- A valid pyramidal plot is defined as a set of fertile cells meeting the criteria specified in the business requirement.
- A valid inverse pyramidal plot is defined as a set of fertile cells meeting the criteria specified in the business requirement.
- The total number of plots is the sum of valid pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots in the `grid`.
