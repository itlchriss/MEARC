- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the 2D integer list parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- Each element in the 2D integer list parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The values in each element of the 2D integer list parameter `edges` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to `n`.
- The values in each element of the 2D integer list parameter `edges` are not equal to each other.
- There are no repeated edges in the 2D integer list parameter `edges`.
- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if it is possible to add at most two additional edges to the graph so that the degree of each node in the graph is even.
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if it is not possible to obtain a valid graph with adding at most 2 edges.
