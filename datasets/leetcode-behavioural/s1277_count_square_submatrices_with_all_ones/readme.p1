Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must not be null.
- The integer result is the total number of square submatrices with all ones in the given `m * n` matrix.
- The total number of squares is the sum of squares of all sides from 1 to the minimum of `m` and `n`.
- The length of the integer matrix parameter `matrix` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 300 for both rows and columns.
- The values in the integer matrix parameter `matrix` are either 0 or 1.
