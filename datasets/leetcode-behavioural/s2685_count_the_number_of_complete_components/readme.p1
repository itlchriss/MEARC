- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is less than or equal to n * (n - 1) / 2.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The integer values in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` are within the range of 0 to n - 1.
- The integer values in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` are unique.
- The integer result is the number of complete connected components in the graph.
- The graph is undirected.
- A connected component is a subgraph where there exists a path between any two vertices and no vertex shares an edge with a vertex outside the subgraph.
- A connected component is complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.
