Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `jug1` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The integer parameter `jug2` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The integer parameter `target` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The boolean result is true if it is possible to measure exactly `target` liters using the two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`.
- If the boolean result is true, there must be `target` liters of water contained within one or both buckets by the end.
