- The integer parameters `jug1Capacity`, `jug2Capacity`, and `targetCapacity` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000.
- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using the two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`.
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if it is not possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using the two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`.
- The water must be contained within one or both buckets by the end of the measurement process.
