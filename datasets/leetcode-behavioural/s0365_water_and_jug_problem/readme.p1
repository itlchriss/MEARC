- The integer parameters `jug1Capacity`, `jug2Capacity`, and `targetCapacity` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^6.
- The boolean result is true if it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using the two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`.
- The boolean result is false if it is not possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using the two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`.
- If `targetCapacity` liters of water are measurable, `targetCapacity` liters of water must be contained within one or both buckets by the end.
