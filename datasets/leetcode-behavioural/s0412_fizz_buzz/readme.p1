- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The size of the string collection result is equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- If the index `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, the string at index `i` in the collection result is "FizzBuzz".
- If the index `i` is divisible by 3, the string at index `i` in the collection result is "Fizz".
- If the index `i` is divisible by 5, the string at index `i` in the collection result is "Buzz".
- If none of the above conditions are true, the string at index `i` in the collection result is the string representation of `i`.
