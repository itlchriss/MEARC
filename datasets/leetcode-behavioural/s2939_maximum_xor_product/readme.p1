- The long parameter `a` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than 2^50.
- The long parameter `b` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than 2^50.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The integer result is the maximum value of `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` where 0 <= x < 2^n.
- The integer result is modulo 10^9 + 7.
