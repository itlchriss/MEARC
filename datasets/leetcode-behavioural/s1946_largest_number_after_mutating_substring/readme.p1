- The string parameter `num` must consist of only digits `0-9`.
- The integer array parameter `change` must have a length of 10.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `change` must be between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
- The string result is the largest possible integer after mutating a single substring of the string parameter `num`.
- The substring to be mutated is contiguous.
- Each digit in the substring is replaced with the digit it maps to in the `change` array.
- The mutated string is the largest number that can be created.
- If the original string is already the largest number that can be created, it remains unchanged.
