- The integer array parameter `nums1` and the integer array parameter `nums2` must be sorted in ascending order.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The size of the list result is equal to the integer parameter `k`.
- Each element in the list result is a list of two integers representing a pair `(u, v)` where `u` is an element from `nums1` and `v` is an element from `nums2`.
- The pairs in the list result are the `k` pairs with the smallest sums.
- The pairs in the list result are selected from the combinations of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The pairs in the list result are ordered by their sums in ascending order.
