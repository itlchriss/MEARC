- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must be sorted in ascending order.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The result is a list of lists containing pairs `(u, v)` with the smallest sums.
- Each pair `(u, v)` consists of one element from the `nums1` array and one element from the `nums2` array.
- The length of the result list is equal to `k`.
- All pairs in the result list have unique combinations of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
