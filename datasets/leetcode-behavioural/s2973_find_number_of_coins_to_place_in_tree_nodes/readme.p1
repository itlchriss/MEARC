- The integer array parameter `edges` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `cost` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `cost` is equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
- The integer array result `coin` is of size `n`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- For each node `i` in the tree:
    - If the size of the subtree of node `i` is less than 3, place 1 coin at node `i`.
    - Otherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the maximum product of cost values assigned to 3 distinct nodes in the subtree of node `i`. If this product is negative, place 0 coins at node `i`.
