- If there exists at least one shortest transformation sequence from the `beginWord` to the `endWord` using the dictionary `wordList`, the result is a list of lists where each inner list represents a sequence of words from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
- If there is no valid transformation sequence from the `beginWord` to the `endWord` using the dictionary `wordList`, the result is an empty list.
