- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the punishment number of the integer parameter `n`.
- The punishment number of `n` is the sum of the squares of all integers `i` such that:
    - `1 <= i <= n`
    - The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.
