- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 400.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `rowC` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `colC` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- Each sub-array in the 2D integer array parameter `rowC` and `colC` has a length of 2.
- The values in the sub-arrays of the 2D integer array parameter `rowC` and `colC` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to `k`.
- The first value in each sub-array of the 2D integer array parameter `rowC` is not equal to the second value.
- The first value in each sub-array of the 2D integer array parameter `colC` is not equal to the second value.
- The integer 2D array result represents a `k x k` matrix where each number from 1 to `k` appears exactly once.
- The remaining cells in the matrix have the value 0.
- The matrix satisfies the conditions specified by the `rowC` and `colC` arrays.
- If no matrix can satisfy all the conditions, the method returns an empty matrix.
