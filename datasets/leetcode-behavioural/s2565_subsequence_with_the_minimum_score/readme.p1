- The integer result is 0 if no characters are removed from string `t`.
- If characters are removed from string `t`, the score is calculated as `right - left + 1`, where `left` is the minimum index among all removed characters and `right` is the maximum index among all removed characters.
- The strings `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.
