- The integer matrix parameter `img1` and `img2` must be square matrices of size `n x n`.
- The integer result is the largest possible overlap between the two images.
- The overlap is calculated by counting the number of positions that have a `1` in both images after translating one image by sliding all the `1` bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units.
- The translation does not include any rotation, and any `1` bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.
