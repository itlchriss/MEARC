Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer matrix parameter `img1` and `img2` must be square matrices of size `n x n`.
- The integer result is the largest possible overlap between the two images after translating one image by sliding all the `1` bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units and placing it on top of the other image.
- A translation does not include any kind of rotation, and any `1` bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.
