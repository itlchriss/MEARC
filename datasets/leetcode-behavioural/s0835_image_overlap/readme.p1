- The integer matrix parameter `img1` and `img2` are square matrices of size `n x n`.
- The integer result is the largest possible overlap between the two images.
- The translation of one image involves sliding all the `1` bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units.
- Any `1` bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.
- The number of positions that have a `1` in both images is counted to determine the overlap.
- The integer result is equal to the number of positions that have a `1` in both images after the translation.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.
