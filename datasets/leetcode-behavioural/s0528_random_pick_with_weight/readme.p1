- The integer array parameter `w` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `w` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `w` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The method `pickIndex()` randomly picks an index in the range `[0, w.length - 1]` inclusive.
- The probability of picking an index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.
- The method `pickIndex()` will be called at most 10000 times.
