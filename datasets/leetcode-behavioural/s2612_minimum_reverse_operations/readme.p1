- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `p` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than `n`.
- The integer array parameter `banned` contains unique values and each value is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than `n`.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `n`.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to `n`.
- Each element in the integer array result is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the `1` to the corresponding position in the array `arr`.
- If it is impossible to bring the `1` to a specific position due to the presence of banned positions, the corresponding element in the result array is equal to -1.
