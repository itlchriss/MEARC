- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `p` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than `n`.
- The integer array parameter `banned` contains unique values and each value is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than `n`.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer array result `ans` has a length of `n`.
- For each index `i` in the result array `ans`, the value is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the `1` to position `i` in the array `arr`.
- If it is impossible to bring the `1` to a certain position due to the presence of banned positions, the corresponding value in the result array `ans` is `-1`.
