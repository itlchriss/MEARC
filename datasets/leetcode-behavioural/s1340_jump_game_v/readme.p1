- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `arr` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `d` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `arr`.
- The integer result is the maximum number of indices that can be visited by following the jumping rules specified in the business requirement.
- The jumping rules specify that a jump can only be made from index `i` to index `j` if `arr[i] > arr[j]` and `arr[i] > arr[k]` for all indices `k` between `i` and `j`.
- The jumping rules also specify that the jump can be made from index `i` to index `j` if `i + x < arr.length` and `0 < x <= d`, or `i - x >= 0` and `0 < x <= d`.
- The jumping rules further specify that the jump cannot go outside of the array at any time.
