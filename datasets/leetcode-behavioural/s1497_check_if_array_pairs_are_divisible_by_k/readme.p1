- The integer array parameter `arr` has an even length `n`.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if it is possible to divide the array `arr` into exactly `n / 2` pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if it is not possible to divide the array `arr` into exactly `n / 2` pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.
