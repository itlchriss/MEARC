Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be between 1 and 100.
- The integer list parameter `logs` must have a length between 1 and 500.
- The integer function ID `function_id` in the logs must be between 0 and n-1.
- The timestamp `timestamp` in the logs must be between 0 and 10^9.
- No two start events can happen at the same timestamp.
- No two end events can happen at the same timestamp.
- Each function ID has an "end" log for each "start" log.
- The integer array result must contain the exclusive time for each function ID.
