- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the list parameter `logs` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- Each element in the list parameter `logs` is formatted as a string `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`.
- The integer result is an array where the value at the i-th index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.
- The exclusive time of a function is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program.
- The exclusive time is calculated based on the start and end timestamps in the logs.
- A function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.
- The exclusive time includes the time spent by the function itself and any recursive calls it makes.
- The exclusive time for a function is the total time it spends executing, including any recursive calls.
- The exclusive time for each function is calculated based on the logs provided.
- The exclusive time for a function is the difference between the end timestamp and the start timestamp of that function.
- The exclusive time for a function is the sum of all execution times for that function in the logs.
- The exclusive time for a function is calculated by considering the timestamps of start and end events for that function.
- The exclusive time for a function is the total time spent executing that function, including any recursive calls it makes.
