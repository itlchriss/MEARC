- The integer array parameter `arr` has a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 500.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `arr`.
- The integer result is the largest sum of the integer array `arr` after partitioning.
- The length of each subarray after partitioning is at most `k`.
- The values in each subarray after partitioning are changed to the maximum value of that subarray.
