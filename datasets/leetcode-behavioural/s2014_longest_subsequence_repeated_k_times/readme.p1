- The string parameter `s` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 2000.
- The length of the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than `k * 8`.
- The string result is the longest subsequence repeated `k` times in the string `s`.
- If multiple longest subsequences repeated `k` times are found, the lexicographically largest one is returned.
- If there is no subsequence repeated `k` times, an empty string is returned.
