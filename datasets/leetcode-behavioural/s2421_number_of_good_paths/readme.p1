- The integer array parameter `vals` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `vals` is equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- The integer array parameter `edges` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- The integer array parameter `edges` contains pairs of integers representing edges between nodes.
- The integer result is the number of distinct good paths in the tree.
- A good path is a simple path where the starting and ending nodes have the same value, and all nodes between them have values less than or equal to the starting node.
- Paths and their reverse are counted as the same path.
- Single nodes are considered valid paths.
- The constraints for the input parameters must be adhered to.
