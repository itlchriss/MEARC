- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer parameters `minK` and `maxK` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000.
- The long result is the number of fixed-bound subarrays in the integer array `nums` where the minimum value is equal to `minK` and the maximum value is equal to `maxK`.
