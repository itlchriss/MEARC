- The integer parameter `num` is a positive integer consisting of exactly four digits.
- The integer result is the minimum possible sum of the two new integers `new1` and `new2` obtained by splitting the digits of the integer parameter `num`.
- All digits found in the integer parameter `num` must be used in the two new integers `new1` and `new2`.
- Leading zeros are allowed in the two new integers `new1` and `new2`.
- The minimum sum is calculated by adding the two new integers `new1` and `new2`.
