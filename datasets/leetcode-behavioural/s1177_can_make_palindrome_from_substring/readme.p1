- The string parameter `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- The integer array parameter `queries` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer array parameter `queries` contains arrays of length 3 where each array represents a query with elements `left`, `right`, and `k`.
- The integer result is a list of boolean values where each boolean value represents the result of the corresponding query in the `queries` array.
- For each query, the substring of `s` from index `left` to index `right` inclusive can be rearranged and up to `k` characters can be replaced with any lowercase English letter.
- If the substring after the operations above can be rearranged to form a palindrome string, the boolean result is equal to the true literal. Otherwise, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
