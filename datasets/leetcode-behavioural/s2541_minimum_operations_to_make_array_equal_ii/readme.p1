- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have equal length `n`.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to make `nums1` equal to `nums2`.
- If it is impossible to make `nums1` equal to `nums2`, the result is -1.
