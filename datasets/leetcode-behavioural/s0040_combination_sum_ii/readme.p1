Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `candidates` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `candidates` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- All values in the integer array parameter `candidates` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 50.
- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 30.
- The result is a list of lists of integers.
- Each list in the result contains unique combinations of numbers from the `candidates` array that sum to the `target`.
- Each number in the `candidates` array can only be used once in a combination.
- The solution set does not contain duplicate combinations.
