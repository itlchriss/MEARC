- The integer array parameter `nums` and `target` must have the same length.
- All values in the integer array parameters `nums` and `target` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to make the integer array `nums` similar to the integer array `target`.
- In each operation, two distinct indices `i` and `j` are chosen where `0 <= i, j < nums.length`.
- In each operation, `nums[i]` is incremented by 2 and `nums[j]` is decremented by 2.
- Two arrays are considered similar if the frequency of each element is the same.
