- The integer array parameter `nums` and `target` must have the same length.
- The integer array parameter `nums` and `target` must contain positive integers.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to make the integer array `nums` similar to the integer array `target`.
- In one operation, two distinct indices `i` and `j` can be chosen where `0 <= i, j < nums.length`.
- In each operation, `nums[i]` is incremented by 2 and `nums[j]` is decremented by 2.
- Two arrays are considered similar if the frequency of each element is the same.
- The test cases are generated such that `nums` can always be made similar to `target`.
