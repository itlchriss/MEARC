Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` is modified during the operation.
- The concatenation value of `nums` is initially equal to 0.
- If there exists more than one number in `nums`, the concatenation value is updated by adding the concatenation of the first and last elements to the current concatenation value, and then deleting these elements from `nums`.
- If there is only one element in `nums`, the concatenation value is updated by adding the value of this element to the current concatenation value, and then deleting this element from `nums`.
- The final result returned is the concatenation value of `nums`.
