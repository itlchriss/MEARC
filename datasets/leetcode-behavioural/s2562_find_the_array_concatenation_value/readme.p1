- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the concatenation value of the integer array `nums`.
- If there exists more than one number in `nums`, the concatenation value is calculated by picking the first element and last element in `nums` respectively, adding the value of their concatenation to the concatenation value of `nums`, and then deleting the first and last element from `nums`.
- If only one element exists in `nums`, its value is added to the concatenation value of `nums` and then deleted.
- The concatenation value is returned as the final result.
