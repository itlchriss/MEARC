- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The string parameter `num` has a length greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of adjacent digit swaps needed to reach the kth smallest wonderful integer.
- The result is obtained by swapping adjacent digits in the string `num` to form the kth smallest wonderful integer.
- The swaps are performed by swapping the digits at the specified indices in the string `num`.
- The swaps are performed in ascending order of indices.
- The swaps are performed to transform `num` into the kth smallest wonderful integer.
