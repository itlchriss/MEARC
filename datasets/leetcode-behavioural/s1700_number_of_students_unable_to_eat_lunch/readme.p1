- If the integer array parameter `students` and the integer array parameter `sandwiches` are both not null and have the same length,
- The integer result is the number of students that are unable to eat.
- If a student prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
- If a student does not prefer the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will leave it and go to the end of the queue.
- The process continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
