- The integer array parameter `ranks` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `ranks` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `ranks` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameter `cars` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000.
- The long result is the minimum time taken to repair all the cars.
- The time taken to repair cars by each mechanic is calculated as `rank * n^2` minutes, where `rank` is the mechanic's rank and `n` is the number of cars repaired.
- All mechanics repair cars simultaneously.
