- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the maximum sub-array sum in the modified array after repeating `arr` `k` times.
- The length of the sub-array can be 0, and its sum in that case is 0.
- The answer is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
