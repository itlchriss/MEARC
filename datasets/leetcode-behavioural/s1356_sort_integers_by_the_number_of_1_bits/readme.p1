- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `arr`.
- The integers in the integer array result are sorted in ascending order by the number of `1`'s in their binary representation.
- If two or more integers have the same number of `1`'s, they are sorted in ascending order.
- The integers in the integer array result are unique.
