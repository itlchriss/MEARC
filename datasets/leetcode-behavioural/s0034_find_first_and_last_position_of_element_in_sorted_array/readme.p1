- The integer array parameter `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The integer parameter `target` is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.
- The integer array result has a length of 2.
- If the `target` value is found in the `nums` array, the first element of the result array is the starting position of the `target` value in the `nums` array.
- If the `target` value is found in the `nums` array, the second element of the result array is the ending position of the `target` value in the `nums` array.
- If the `target` value is not found in the `nums` array, both elements of the result array are -1.
