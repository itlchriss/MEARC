- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the number of good integers in the range [1, n].
- A good integer is defined as an integer where after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from the original number.
- Valid numbers are those where each digit remains a digit after rotation, such as 0, 1, 8, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Invalid numbers are those where the digits do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.
- The output should be the count of good integers in the range [1, n].
