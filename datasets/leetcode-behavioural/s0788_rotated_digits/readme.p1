- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the number of good integers in the range [1, n].
- A number is considered good if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from the original number.
- Each digit must be rotated, and we cannot choose to leave it alone.
- A valid number is one where each digit remains a digit after rotation.
- The digits 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves.
- The digits 2 and 5 rotate to each other.
- The digits 6 and 9 rotate to each other.
- The rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.
