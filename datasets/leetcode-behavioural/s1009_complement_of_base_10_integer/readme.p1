- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than 10^9.
- The integer result is the complement of the binary representation of the integer parameter `n`.
- The binary complement is obtained by flipping all `0`'s to `1`'s and all `1`'s to `0`'s in the binary representation of the integer parameter `n`.
