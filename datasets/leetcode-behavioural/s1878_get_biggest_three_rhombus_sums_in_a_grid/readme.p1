Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must have dimensions `m x n`.
- The integer result is an array containing the three biggest distinct rhombus sums in descending order.
- If there are less than three distinct values, the result array contains all of them.
- The rhombus sum is the sum of the elements that form the border of a regular rhombus shape in the grid.
- The rhombus must have the shape of a square rotated 45 degrees with each of the corners centered in a grid cell.
- The rhombus can have an area of 0.
- The result array contains the three biggest distinct rhombus sums.
- The result array is sorted in descending order.
