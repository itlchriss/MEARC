- The integer array parameter `nums` is modified in-place to remove all occurrences of the integer parameter `val`.
- The relative order of the elements in the integer array `nums` may be changed after removing the occurrences of `val`.
- The first `k` elements of the integer array `nums` hold the final result after removing the occurrences of `val`.
- The integer result `k` is returned after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of the integer array `nums`.
- The integer result `k` is equal to the length of the expected answer with correct length.
- The integer array `nums` is sorted in ascending order for the first `k` elements.
- All values in the integer array `nums` beyond the first `k` elements are not specified and can be ignored.
- The integer parameter `val` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the integer array `nums` is less than or equal to 100.
