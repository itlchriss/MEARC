- If the character at index `i` in the string `locked` is '1', the character at index `i` in the string `s` cannot be changed.
- If the character at index `i` in the string `locked` is '0', the character at index `i` in the string `s` can be changed to either '(' or ')'.
- The boolean result is true if it is possible to make the string `s` a valid parentheses string by changing the characters at the indices where `locked` is '0'.
- The boolean result is false if it is not possible to make the string `s` a valid parentheses string by changing the characters at the indices where `locked` is '0'.
