- The string parameter `s` must have a length greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the number of unique palindromes of length three that are subsequences of the string parameter `s`.
- The result should only count each unique palindrome once, even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence.
- A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
- A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
