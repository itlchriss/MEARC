- The integer array parameter `jobs` contains the amount of time it takes to complete each job.
- The integer parameter `k` represents the number of workers available.
- Each job must be assigned to exactly one worker.
- The working time of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them.
- The goal is to minimize the maximum working time of any worker.
- The integer result is the minimum possible maximum working time of any assignment.
- The constraints are that `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12` and `1 <= jobs[i] <= 10^7`.
