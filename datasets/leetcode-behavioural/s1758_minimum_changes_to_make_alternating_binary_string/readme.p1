- The integer parameter `s` is a string consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations needed to make the string `s` alternating.
- If the string `s` is already alternating, the integer result is 0.
- If the string `s` is not alternating, the integer result is the minimum number of operations needed to make it alternating.
