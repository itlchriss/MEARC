Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must not be null.
- The resulting matrix is the same size as the input matrix `mat`.
- Each matrix diagonal in the resulting matrix is sorted in ascending order.
- The sorting of each matrix diagonal starts from the topmost row or leftmost column and proceeds towards the bottom-right direction.
- The values in each matrix diagonal are rearranged in ascending order without changing their positions relative to each other.
