- The integer array parameter `arr1` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `arr2` must not be null.
- The integer result is the XOR sum of the bitwise AND of all elements in the list created by performing `arr1[i] AND arr2[j]` for every combination of indices `i` and `j`.
- The XOR sum is calculated by performing bitwise XOR on all elements in the list created by performing `arr1[i] AND arr2[j]` for every combination of indices `i` and `j`.
