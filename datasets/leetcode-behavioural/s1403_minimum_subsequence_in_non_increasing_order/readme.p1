- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The size of the integer list result is less than or equal to the size of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The sum of elements in the integer list result is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included in the result.
- If there are multiple solutions, the result is the subsequence with the minimum size.
- If there are still multiple solutions, the result is the subsequence with the maximum total sum of all its elements.
- The result is sorted in non-increasing order.
