- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer collection result is a subsequence of the integer array parameter `nums` such that the sum of its elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included in the subsequence.
- If there are multiple solutions, the subsequence returned must have the minimum size.
- If there are still multiple solutions, the subsequence returned must have the maximum total sum of all its elements.
- The elements in the integer collection result must be sorted in non-increasing order.
