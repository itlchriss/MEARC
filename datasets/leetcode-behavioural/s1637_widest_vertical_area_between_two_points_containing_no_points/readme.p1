- The integer parameter `points` is a 2D array where each element is an array of length 2 representing a point `[x, y]`.
- The integer result is the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.
- The points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
- The width of the vertical area is the maximum width possible.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The x and y coordinates of each point in the `points` array are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
