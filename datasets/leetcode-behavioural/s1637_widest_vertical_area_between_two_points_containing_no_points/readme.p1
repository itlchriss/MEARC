- The integer parameter `points` is a 2D array where each element is an array of length 2 representing a point `[x, y]`.
- The integer result is the maximum width of the vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.
- Points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
- The width of the vertical area is calculated based on the x-coordinates of the points.
- The result is greater than or equal to 0.
