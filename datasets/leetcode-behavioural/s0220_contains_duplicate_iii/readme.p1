- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -2147483648 and are less than or equal to 2147483647.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer parameter `t` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.
- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if there exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the integer array parameter `nums` such that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is less than or equal to `t` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k`.
