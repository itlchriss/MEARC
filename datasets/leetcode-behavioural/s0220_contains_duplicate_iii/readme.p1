- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The integer parameter `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- If there exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the integer array parameter `nums` such that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is less than or equal to `t` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the boolean result is true.
