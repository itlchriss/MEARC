- The integer array parameter `points` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 200000000.
- The integer result is the maximum value of the equation `yi + yj + |xi - xj|` where `|xi - xj| <= k` and `1 <= i < j <= points.length`.
- It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint `|xi - xj| <= k`.
