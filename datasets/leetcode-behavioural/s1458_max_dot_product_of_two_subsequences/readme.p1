- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of the integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` with the same length.
- The maximum dot product is calculated by taking the dot product of two subsequences, one from `nums1` and one from `nums2`, with the same length.
- The dot product of two subsequences is calculated by multiplying the corresponding elements of the two subsequences and summing the results.
- The dot product of two subsequences is calculated by taking the dot product of two subsequences, one from `nums1` and one from `nums2`, with the same length.
