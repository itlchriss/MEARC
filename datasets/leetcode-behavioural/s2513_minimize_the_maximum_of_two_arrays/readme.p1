- The integer parameter `divisor1` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `divisor2` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `uniqueCnt1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `uniqueCnt2` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than 1000000000.
- The sum of integer parameters `uniqueCnt1` and `uniqueCnt2` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer result is the minimum possible maximum integer that can be present in either array `arr1` or `arr2`.
- The integers in array `arr1` are distinct positive integers and are not divisible by `divisor1`.
- The integers in array `arr2` are distinct positive integers and are not divisible by `divisor2`.
- No integer is present in both array `arr1` and `arr2`.
