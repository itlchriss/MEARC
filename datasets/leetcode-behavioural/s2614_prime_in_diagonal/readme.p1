- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the largest prime number that lies on at least one of the diagonals of the integer array `nums`.
- If no prime number is present on any of the diagonals, the integer result is equal to 0.
- An integer is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
- An integer `val` is considered to be on one of the diagonals of `nums` if there exists an integer `i` for which `nums[i][i] = val` or an `i` for which `nums[i][nums.length - i - 1] = val`.
- The integer array `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 300.
- All values in the two-dimensional integer array `nums` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 4*10^6.
