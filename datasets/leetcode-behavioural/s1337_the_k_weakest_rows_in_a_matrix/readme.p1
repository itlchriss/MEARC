Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the number of rows in the matrix `mat`.
- The integer array result contains the indices of the `k` weakest rows in the matrix `mat`, ordered from weakest to strongest.
- A row `i` is weaker than a row `j` if either the number of soldiers in row `i` is less than the number of soldiers in row `j`, or if both rows have the same number of soldiers and `i < j`.
