- The integer 2D array parameter `intervals` must not be null.
- The integer 2D array parameter `intervals` must have a length greater than or equal to 1.
- Each sub-array within the integer 2D array parameter `intervals` must have a length of 2.
- The integer result is a 2D array of non-overlapping intervals that cover all intervals in the input.
- Overlapping intervals in the input must be merged into a single interval in the output.
- The start value of each interval in the output must be less than or equal to the end value.
- The output intervals must cover all intervals in the input.
