- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- If there exists a pivot integer `x` such that the sum of all elements between 1 and `x` inclusively equals the sum of all elements between `x` and `n` inclusively, the integer result is equal to `x`.
- If no such integer `x` exists, the integer result is equal to -1.
