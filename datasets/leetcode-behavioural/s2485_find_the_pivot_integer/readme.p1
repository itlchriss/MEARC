- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- If there exists a pivot integer `x`, the sum of all elements between 1 and `x` inclusively is equal to the sum of all elements between `x` and `n` inclusively.
- If there is no pivot integer `x` that satisfies the condition, the integer result is -1.
