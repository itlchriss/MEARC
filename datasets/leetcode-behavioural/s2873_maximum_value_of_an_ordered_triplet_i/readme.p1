- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 100.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000.
- The long result is the maximum value over all triplets of indices `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` calculated as `(nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k]`.
- If all triplets of indices have a negative value, the long result is 0.
