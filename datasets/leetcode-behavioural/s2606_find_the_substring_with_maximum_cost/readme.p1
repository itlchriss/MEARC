- The integer result is the maximum cost among all substrings of the string `s`.
- The cost of an empty string is considered 0.
- The cost of a substring is the sum of the values of each character in the substring.
- If a character in the substring is not in the string `chars`, then its value is its corresponding position (1-indexed) in the alphabet.
- If a character in the substring is in the string `chars`, then its value is the corresponding value in the `vals` array at the same index as the character in `chars`.
- The value of characters in the substring is calculated as described above.
- The maximum cost among all substrings of the string `s` is returned as the integer result.
