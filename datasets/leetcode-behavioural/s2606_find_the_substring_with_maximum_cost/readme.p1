- The integer result is the maximum cost among all substrings of the string `s`.
- The cost of an empty string is considered 0.
- The value of a character not in the string `chars` is its corresponding position in the alphabet (1-indexed).
- The value of a character in the string `chars` is the corresponding value in the `vals` array at the same index.
- The maximum cost substring must be calculated based on the defined character values and their positions in the string `s`.
