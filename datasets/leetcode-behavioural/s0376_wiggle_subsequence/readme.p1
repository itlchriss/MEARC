- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of the integer array `nums`.
- The differences between successive numbers in the wiggle subsequence strictly alternate between positive and negative.
- The first difference in the wiggle subsequence may be either positive or negative.
- A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are considered trivially wiggle sequences.
