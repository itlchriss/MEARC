- If the string parameter `sentence` is not null and consists of words separated by spaces, the string result is the final sentence representing the conversion from `sentence` to Goat Latin.
- Each word in the resulting sentence follows the rules of Goat Latin:
    - If a word begins with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), append "ma" to the end of the word.
    - If a word begins with a consonant, remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
    - Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
- The resulting sentence consists of words separated by spaces.
- The resulting sentence has no leading or trailing spaces.
