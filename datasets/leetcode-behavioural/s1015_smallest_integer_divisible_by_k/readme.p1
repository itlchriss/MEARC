- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- If there exists a positive integer `n` that is divisible by `k` and only contains the digit `1`, the integer result is the length of `n`.
- If there is no such positive integer `n` that satisfies the conditions, the integer result is -1.
