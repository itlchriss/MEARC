- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `indices` is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer array parameter `indices` contains pairs of integers representing 0-indexed locations.
- For each pair of integers in `indices`, all cells in the corresponding row and column are incremented.
- The result is the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increments specified in `indices`.
- The result is an integer.
