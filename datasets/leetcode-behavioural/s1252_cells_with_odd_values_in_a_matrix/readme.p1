- The integer parameters `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 50.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `indices` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer result is the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in `indices`.
- The final matrix contains only integers.
- The final matrix dimensions are `m x n`.
- The final matrix cells are incremented based on the indices provided.
- The final matrix cells are incremented by both row and column for each location in `indices`.
- The final matrix cells are considered odd if their value is not divisible by 2.
- The method should solve the problem in `O(n + m + indices.length)` time complexity.
- The method should use only `O(n + m)` extra space.
