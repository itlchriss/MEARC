- The string parameter `s` must consist of digits only.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The string result is obtained after completing all rounds as described in the business requirement.
- In each round, the string `s` is divided into consecutive groups of size `k`.
- Each group is replaced with a string representing the sum of all its digits.
- The consecutive groups are then merged together to form a new string.
- The process is repeated until the length of the string is less than or equal to `k`.
- The final string result is returned.
