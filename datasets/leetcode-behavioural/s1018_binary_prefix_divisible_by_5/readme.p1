- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are either 0 or 1.
- The length of the boolean list result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- Each boolean value in the boolean list result is true if the number represented by the binary subarray `nums[0..i]` is divisible by 5, where i is the index of the boolean value in the result list.
- Each boolean value in the boolean list result is false if the number represented by the binary subarray `nums[0..i]` is not divisible by 5.
