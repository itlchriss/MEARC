Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer matrix `maxLocal` result must be a matrix of size `(n - 2) x (n - 2)`.
- Each element `maxLocal[i][j]` in the result matrix corresponds to the largest value of the `3 x 3` matrix in `grid` centered around row `i + 1` and column `j + 1`.
- The values in the result matrix `maxLocal` are the largest values in every contiguous `3 x 3` matrix in `grid`.
