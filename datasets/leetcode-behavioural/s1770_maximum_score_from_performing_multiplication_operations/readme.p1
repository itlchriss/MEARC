- The integer array parameter `nums` and `multipliers` are 1-indexed.
- The integer array parameter `nums` has a size of `n` and the integer array parameter `multipliers` has a size of `m`, where `n >= m`.
- The integer result is the maximum score after performing `m` operations.
- On each operation, one integer `x` is chosen from either the start or the end of the array `nums`.
- The score is calculated by adding `multipliers[i] * x` to the current score.
- The chosen integer `x` is removed from the array `nums` after each operation.
- Exactly `m` operations must be performed.
- The total score is the sum of all scores obtained from the operations.
- The maximum score is returned as the final result.
