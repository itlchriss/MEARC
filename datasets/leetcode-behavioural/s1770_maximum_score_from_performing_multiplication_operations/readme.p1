- The integer array parameter `nums` and `multipliers` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `multipliers`.
- The integer result is the maximum score after performing exactly `m` operations.
- The integer result is the sum of the products of the chosen integers from either the start or the end of the array `nums` and the corresponding multipliers.
- The chosen integer `x` is removed from the array `nums` after each operation.
- The total score is the sum of all products calculated during the operations.
