- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` contains only positive integers.
- The integer result is the average value of all even integers in the `nums` array that are divisible by 3.
- The average value is calculated by summing all qualifying even integers and dividing by the count of such integers, rounded down to the nearest integer.
- If there are no even integers in the `nums` array that are divisible by 3, the result is 0.
