- The integer parameter `maxChoosableInteger` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20.
- The integer parameter `desiredTotal` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 300.
- The boolean result is true if the first player can force a win, otherwise false.
- The first player and the second player play optimally.
- The first player cannot reuse integers that have been chosen previously.
- The first player and the second player take turns choosing integers from 1 to `maxChoosableInteger`.
- The running total starts from 0 and the player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed `desiredTotal` wins.
- The method should return true if the first player can force a win under the given constraints.
