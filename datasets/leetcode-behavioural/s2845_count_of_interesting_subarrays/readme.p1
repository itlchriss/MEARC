Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer list parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `modulo` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than `modulo`.
- The long result is the count of interesting subarrays.
- An interesting subarray `nums[l..r]` is defined as a subarray where the count `cnt` of indices `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that `nums[i] % modulo == k` satisfies the condition `cnt % modulo == k`.
- The output format should be a list with '-' as bullets.
