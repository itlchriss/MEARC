- The integer array parameter `blocked` may contain up to 200 blocked squares, each represented by a pair of coordinates.
- Each pair of coordinates in the integer array parameter `blocked` represents a blocked square with coordinates within the range of 0 to 1000000.
- The integer array parameters `source` and `target` each contain two coordinates representing the source and target squares respectively.
- The boolean result is true if and only if it is possible to reach the target square from the source square through a sequence of valid moves.
- Valid moves include walking one square north, east, south, or west, as long as the square is not in the array of blocked squares.
- It is not allowed to walk outside of the grid boundaries.
- The source square and target square are not blocked and are distinct from each other.
