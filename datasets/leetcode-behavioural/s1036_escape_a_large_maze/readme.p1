- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if and only if it is possible to reach the target square from the source square through a sequence of valid moves.
- The integer array parameter `blocked` may contain up to 200 elements, where each element is an array of length 2.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `blocked` represents a blocked square with coordinates within the range of 0 to 1000000.
- The integer array parameters `source` and `target` are arrays of length 2, representing the coordinates of the source and target squares respectively.
- The source square is not equal to the target square.
- It is guaranteed that the source and target squares are not blocked.
