- The integer parameter `memory1` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.
- The integer parameter `memory2` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.
- The integer array result contains three elements: `crashTime`, `memory1_crash`, and `memory2_crash`.
- The `crashTime` is the time (in seconds) when the program crashes.
- The `memory1_crash` is the available bits of memory in the first stick after the program crashes.
- The `memory2_crash` is the available bits of memory in the second stick after the program crashes.
