- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer result is the k<sup>th</sup> factor of `n` in the list of factors of `n` sorted in ascending order.
- If `n` has less than `k` factors, the result is -1.
