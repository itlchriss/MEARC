- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `points`.
- The integer array result has a length of `k`.
- Each element in the integer array result is a point represented as an array `[x, y]`.
- The points in the integer array result are the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)` based on Euclidean distance.
- The order of the points in the result array is not specified as long as they are the closest `k` points to the origin.
- The result array contains unique points.
