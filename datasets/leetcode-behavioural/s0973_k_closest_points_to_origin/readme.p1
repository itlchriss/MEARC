- The integer array parameter `points` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `points`.
- The integer array result contains `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)` based on Euclidean distance.
- The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is calculated using the formula sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).
- The order of the points in the result array is not specified, as long as the points are the closest to the origin.
- The result array is guaranteed to be unique.
