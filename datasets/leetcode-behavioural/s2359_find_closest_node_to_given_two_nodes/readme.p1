- The integer array parameter `edges` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `edges` must have a size of `n`.
- The integer array parameter `edges` must contain values from -1 to n-1.
- The integer parameters `node1` and `node2` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than n.
- The integer result is the index of the node that can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`, such that the maximum between the distance from `node1` to that node, and from `node2` to that node is minimized.
- If there are multiple answers, the result is the node with the smallest index.
- If no possible answer exists, the result is -1.
