- The integer matrix parameter `grid` represents a binary matrix where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
- An island is defined as a group of connected 1's in the matrix that are not connected to any other 1's.
- There are exactly two islands in the matrix `grid`.
- The integer result is the smallest number of 0's that must be flipped to connect the two islands and form one island.
