- The integer matrix parameter `grid` represents a binary matrix where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` has exactly two islands, which are 4-directionally connected groups of 1's not connected to any other 1's.
- The integer result is the smallest number of 0's that must be flipped to connect the two islands and form one island.
