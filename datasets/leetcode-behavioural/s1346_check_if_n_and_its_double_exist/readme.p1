- The integer array parameter `arr` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` must be greater than or equal to -1000 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if there exist two indices `i` and `j` such that:
    - `i` is not equal to `j`
    - `0 <= i, j < arr.length`
    - `arr[i]` is equal to `2 * arr[j]`
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if there does not exist two indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the above conditions.
