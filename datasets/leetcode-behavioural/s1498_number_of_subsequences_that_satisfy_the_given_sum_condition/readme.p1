- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer result is the number of non-empty subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to `target`.
- The integer result is modulo 10^9 + 7.
