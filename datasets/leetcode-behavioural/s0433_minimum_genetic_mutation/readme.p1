- The integer result is the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from the gene string `start` to the gene string `end`.
- If there is no valid mutation path from the gene string `start` to the gene string `end`, the integer result is -1.
- The gene string `start` is assumed to be a valid starting point and might not be included in the gene bank.
- The gene bank `bank` records all valid gene mutations.
- The gene bank `bank` may contain 0 to 10 gene strings, each of length 8.
- The gene strings `start`, `end`, and each gene string in the gene bank `bank` consist of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.
- The length of the gene strings `start` and `end` is 8 characters.
