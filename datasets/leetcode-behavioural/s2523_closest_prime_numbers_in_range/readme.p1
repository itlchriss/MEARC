- The integer parameter `left` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer parameter `right` is greater than or equal to `left` and is less than or equal to 1000000.
- The length of the integer array result is 2.
- The integer array result contains two prime numbers `num1` and `num2` such that `left <= num1 < num2 <= right`.
- The absolute difference between `num2` and `num1` is the minimum among all pairs of prime numbers satisfying the conditions.
- If there are multiple pairs satisfying the conditions, the pair with the minimum `num1` value is returned.
- If no such prime numbers exist in the given range, the result is `[-1, -1]`.
