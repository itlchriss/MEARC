- The integer parameter `low` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer parameter `high` is greater than or equal to `low` and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the number of symmetric integers in the range `[low, high]`.
- A symmetric integer `x` with `2 * n` digits has the sum of the first `n` digits equal to the sum of the last `n` digits.
- Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric.
