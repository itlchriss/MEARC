- The integer 2D array parameter `times` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer result is the time it takes for all `n` nodes to receive the signal.
- If it is impossible for all `n` nodes to receive the signal, the integer result is -1.
