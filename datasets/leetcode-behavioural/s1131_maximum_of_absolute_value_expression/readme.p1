- The integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2` must have equal lengths.
- The integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 40000.
- All values in the integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2` must be greater than or equal to -10^6 and less than or equal to 10^6.
- The integer result is the maximum value of the expression `|arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j|` for all valid indices `i` and `j` in the arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.
