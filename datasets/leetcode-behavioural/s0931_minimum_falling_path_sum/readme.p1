- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` is a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer result is the minimum sum of any falling path through the integer matrix `matrix`.
- A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either directly below or diagonally left/right.
- The next element from position `(row, col)` will be `(row + 1, col - 1)`, `(row + 1, col)`, or `(row + 1, col + 1)`.
- The falling path with the minimum sum must be determined.
- All values in the integer matrix `matrix` are within the range of -100 to 100.
