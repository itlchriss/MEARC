- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of 200 and `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 3.
- The first element of each edge is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than the second element, which is less than `n`.
- The weight of each edge is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All pairs of nodes `(a_i, b_i)` in the edges are distinct.
- The output is a list containing two lists, where the first list represents the critical edges and the second list represents the pseudo-critical edges.
- The critical edges are the edges that appear in all minimum spanning trees (MSTs).
- The pseudo-critical edges are the edges that appear in some but not all MSTs.
- The indices of the edges can be returned in any order.
