- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of 200 and `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
- Each element in the integer array `edges` has a length of 3.
- The first element of each edge is less than the second element and both are within the range of 0 to `n`.
- The weight of each edge is within the range of 1 to 1000.
- All pairs of nodes `(a_i, b_i)` in the edges are distinct.
- The output is a list containing two lists, where the first list represents the critical edges and the second list represents the pseudo-critical edges.
