Method behavioural specifications:
- The 2D integer array parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer result is the minimum number of obstacles to remove in order to move from the upper left corner to the lower right corner.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.
- The integer result is less than or equal to the total number of obstacles in the grid.
- The grid must have at least one empty cell at the upper left corner `(0, 0)` and the lower right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)`.
- The grid must have a size of `m x n` where `m` and `n` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- Each cell in the grid must have a value of either 0 (empty cell) or 1 (obstacle).
- The grid must have at least one path from the upper left corner to the lower right corner.
- The method should return the minimum number of obstacles to remove to create a path from the upper left corner to the lower right corner.
