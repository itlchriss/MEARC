Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The length of the integer array parameter `hBars` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the integer array parameter `vBars` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- All values in the integer array parameter `hBars` are distinct and are in the range [2, n + 1].
- All values in the integer array parameter `vBars` are distinct and are in the range [2, m + 1].
- The integer result is the maximum area of a square-shaped hole in the grid after removing some bars, possibly none.
