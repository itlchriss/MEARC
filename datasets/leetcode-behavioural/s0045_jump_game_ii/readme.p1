- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index in the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The minimum number of jumps is calculated based on the maximum jump length at each position in the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The minimum number of jumps is calculated by jumping from the first index to subsequent indices until reaching the last index.
