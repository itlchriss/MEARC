- The string parameter `s` must not be null.
- The integer result is the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make the string `s` balanced.
- If the string `s` is already balanced, the integer result is 0.
- If the string `s` is not balanced, the integer result is greater than 0.
