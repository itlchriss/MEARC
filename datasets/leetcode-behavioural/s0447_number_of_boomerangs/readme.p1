- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- The integer array parameter `points` contains `n` distinct points in the plane, where each point is represented as an array of two integers `[x, y]`.
- The integer result is the number of boomerangs, where a boomerang is a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` equals the distance between `i` and `k`.
- The order of the tuple matters, meaning that `(i, j, k)` is different from `(i, k, j)`.
- The result is equal to 0 if no boomerangs are found.
- The result is greater than or equal to 0.
