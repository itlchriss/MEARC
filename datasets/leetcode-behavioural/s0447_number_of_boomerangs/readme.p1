Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer 2D array parameter `points` must not be null.
- The integer result is the number of boomerangs formed by the points in the integer 2D array parameter `points`.
- A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) where the distance between i and j is equal to the distance between i and k.
- The order of the tuple matters in determining a boomerang.
