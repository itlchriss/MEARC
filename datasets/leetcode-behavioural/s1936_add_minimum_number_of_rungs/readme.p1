- The integer array parameter `rungs` is strictly increasing.
- The integer array parameter `rungs` contains the height of rungs on a ladder.
- The integer parameter `dist` represents the maximum distance you can climb to the next highest rung.
- The integer result is the minimum number of rungs that must be added to the ladder in order for you to climb to the last rung.
- If the current position cannot reach the last rung, additional rungs must be added at heights that are at most `dist` apart.
- The added rungs must be at positive integer heights.
- The added rungs must be inserted at heights where rungs do not already exist.
- The added rungs must be inserted in such a way that you can climb to the last rung.
- The added rungs must be inserted in the minimum number required to reach the last rung.
