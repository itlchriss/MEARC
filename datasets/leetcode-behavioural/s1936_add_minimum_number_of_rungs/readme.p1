- The integer array parameter `rungs` is strictly increasing.
- The integer array parameter `rungs` contains the height of rungs on a ladder.
- The integer parameter `dist` represents the maximum distance you can climb to the next highest rung.
- The integer result is the minimum number of rungs that must be added to the ladder in order for you to climb to the last rung.
- If you cannot reach the last rung, you need to add rungs at specific heights to climb the ladder.
- The heights of the added rungs should be at positive integer values.
- The added rungs should be at heights where the distance between the current position and the next rung is at most `dist`.
- The added rungs should allow you to reach the last rung on the ladder.
- The added rungs should be inserted in a way that maintains the ladder's strict increasing order of rung heights.
