- If the double parameter `x` is between -100.0 and 100.0, and the integer parameter `n` is between -2^31 and 2^31-1, the double result is equal to `x` raised to the power of `n`.
- If the double parameter `x` is outside the range of -100.0 to 100.0, or the integer parameter `n` is outside the range of -2^31 to 2^31-1, the result is undefined.
