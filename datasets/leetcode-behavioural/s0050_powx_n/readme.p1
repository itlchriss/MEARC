- The double parameter `x` is greater than -100.0 and is less than 100.0.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to -2^31 and is less than or equal to 2^31-1.
- The double result is within the range of -10^4 to 10^4.
- The double result is equal to `x` raised to the power of `n`.
- The double result is equal to 1 if `n` is 0.
- The double result is equal to 1 if `x` is 1.
- The double result is equal to `x` if `n` is 1.
- The double result is equal to 1/`x` if `n` is -1.
- The double result is equal to 1/(`x` * `x`) if `n` is -2.
