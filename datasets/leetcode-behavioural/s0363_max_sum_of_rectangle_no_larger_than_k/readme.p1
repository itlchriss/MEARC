- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to -100000 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` has a number of rows `m` and a number of columns `n` where `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer result is the maximum sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than `k`.
- The sum of the rectangle must be less than or equal to `k`.
- It is guaranteed that there will be a rectangle with a sum no larger than `k`.
