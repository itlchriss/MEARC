- The integer 2D array parameter `image` must not be null.
- The integer parameters `sr` and `sc` must be within the bounds of the integer 2D array `image`.
- The integer result is a modified 2D array `image` after performing the flood fill.
- All pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, and all pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels with the same color, are replaced with the `newColor`.
- The modified image should contain the same color as the starting pixel and all connected pixels with the same color, colored with the `newColor`.
