Method behavioural specifications:
- The 2D grid `grid` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The number of rows `m` in the 2D grid is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The number of columns `n` in each row of the 2D grid is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- All elements in the 2D grid `grid` are integers within the range -1000 to 1000.
- The output is a 2D grid after applying the shift operation `k` times.
- The output 2D grid has the same dimensions as the input 2D grid `grid`.
- The elements in the output 2D grid are shifted according to the specified shift operation rules.
