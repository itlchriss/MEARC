Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer array parameter `nums` contains only 0 or 1 values.
- The integer collection result contains all distinct indices that have the highest possible division score.
- The division score of an index `i` is the sum of the number of `0`'s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` and the number of `1`'s in `nums` from index `i` to `n-1`.
- If multiple indices have the highest possible division score, all of them should be included in the result list.
- The result list can be returned in any order.
