Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer matrix parameter `image` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `image` must be a square matrix (n x n).
- The resulting image is obtained by first reversing each row of the input image matrix, then inverting the values (0 to 1 and 1 to 0) in the resulting matrix.
- The resulting image matrix must have the same dimensions as the input image matrix.
- Each row of the resulting image matrix is the reverse of the corresponding row in the input image matrix.
- Each element in the resulting image matrix is the inversion of the corresponding element in the reversed input image matrix.
