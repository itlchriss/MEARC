- The integer parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of `num` when represented as a string.
- The integer result is the number of substrings of `num` of length `k` that are divisors of `num`.
- Leading zeros are allowed in the substrings.
- The substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in the string representation of `num`.
- The integer 0 is not considered a divisor of any value.
