- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the number of permutations of `nums` that are squareful.
- The permutations `perm1` and `perm2` are considered different if there is some index `i` such that `perm1[i]` is not equal to `perm2[i]`.
