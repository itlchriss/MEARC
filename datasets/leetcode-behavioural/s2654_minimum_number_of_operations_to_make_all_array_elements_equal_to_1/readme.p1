- The integer array parameter `nums` must be a non-empty array consisting of positive integers.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the integer array `nums` equal to 1.
- If it is impossible to make all elements equal to 1, the integer result is -1.
- The gcd of two integers is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.
- The operations allowed involve selecting an index `i` such that `0 <= i < n - 1` and replacing either `nums[i]` or `nums[i+1]` with their gcd value.
- The operations can be performed any number of times to achieve the goal of making all elements equal to 1.
