- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20000.
- The length of the edges array is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and is less than or equal to 40000.
- Each element in the edges array is an array of length 3.
- The first and second elements of each edge array are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to `n`.
- The first and second elements of each edge array are not equal.
- The third element of each edge array is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- There is at most one edge between any two nodes.
- There is at least one path between any two nodes.
- The method must return the number of restricted paths from node 1 to node `n` modulo 10^9 + 7.
