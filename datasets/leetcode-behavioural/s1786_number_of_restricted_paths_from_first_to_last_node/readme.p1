Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 20000.
- The integer array parameter `edges` must have a length greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than or equal to 40000.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` must be an array of length 3.
- The first and second elements of each array in the integer array parameter `edges` must be between 1 and `n`.
- The first and second elements of each array in the integer array parameter `edges` must not be equal.
- The third element of each array in the integer array parameter `edges` must be between 1 and 100000.
- There must be at most one edge between any two nodes.
- There must be at least one path between any two nodes.
- The integer result is the number of restricted paths from node 1 to node `n`, modulo 10^9 + 7.
