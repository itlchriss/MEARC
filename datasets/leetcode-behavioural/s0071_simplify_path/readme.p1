- If the string parameter `path` is an absolute path starting with a slash `'/'`, the string result is the simplified canonical path.
- Any period `'.'` in the string parameter `path` refers to the current directory and should be removed in the string result.
- Any double period `'..'` in the string parameter `path` refers to the directory up a level and should be removed along with the previous directory in the string result.
- Any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) in the string parameter `path` should be treated as a single slash `'/'` in the string result.
- The string result should start with a single slash `'/'`.
- Any two directories in the string result should be separated by a single slash `'/'`.
- The string result should not end with a trailing `'/'`.
- The string result should only contain the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory, without any period `'.'` or double period `'..'`.
