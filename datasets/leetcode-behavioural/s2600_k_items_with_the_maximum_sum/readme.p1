- The integer parameters `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes` must be non-negative.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the sum of `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes`.
- The integer result is the maximum possible sum of numbers written on the items after picking exactly `k` items.
- The items in the bag can have numbers `1`, `0`, or `-1` written on them.
- The bag initially contains `numOnes` items with `1`s, `numZeros` items with `0`s, and `numNegOnes` items with `-1`s.
- The items picked must be from the available items in the bag.
- The sum of the numbers written on the picked items must be maximized.
