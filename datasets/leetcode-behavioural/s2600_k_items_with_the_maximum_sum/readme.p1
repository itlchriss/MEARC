- The integer parameters `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes` must be non-negative.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the sum of `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes`.
- The integer result is the maximum possible sum of numbers written on the items after picking exactly `k` items.
- The items picked must be selected in a way that maximizes the sum of the numbers written on them.
