- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must be sorted in ascending order.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the product of the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The long result is the k<sup>th</sup> smallest product of `nums1[i] * nums2[j]` where 0 <= i < nums1.length and 0 <= j < nums2.length.
- The result is calculated by multiplying the k<sup>th</sup> smallest element from `nums1` with the k<sup>th</sup> smallest element from `nums2`.
- The result is a 1-based index of the smallest product.
