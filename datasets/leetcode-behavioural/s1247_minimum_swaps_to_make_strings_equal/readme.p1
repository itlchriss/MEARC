- If the input strings `s1` and `s2` have different lengths, the integer result is -1.
- If the input strings `s1` and `s2` contain characters other than 'x' and 'y', the integer result is -1.
- If it is possible to make the input strings `s1` and `s2` equal by swapping characters, the integer result is the minimum number of swaps required.
