- If the strings `s1` and `s2` are already equal, the integer result is 0.
- If the strings `s1` and `s2` have different lengths, the integer result is -1.
- If the strings `s1` and `s2` contain characters other than 'x' and 'y', the integer result is -1.
- The integer result is the minimum number of swaps required to make `s1` and `s2` equal.
