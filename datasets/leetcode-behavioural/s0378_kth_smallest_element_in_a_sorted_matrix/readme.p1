- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the square of the length of the `matrix`.
- The integer result is the k<sup>th</sup> smallest element in the sorted order of the `matrix`.
- The memory complexity of the solution is better than O(n<sup>2</sup>).
- The elements in the `matrix` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The integer result is within the range of -10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup>.
- The length of the `matrix` is equal to the length of each row and column, which is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 300.
