- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the square of the length of the `matrix`.
- The integer result is the `k`th smallest element in the sorted order of the `matrix`.
- The memory complexity of the solution is better than O(n^2).
- The elements in the `matrix` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The integer result is unique.
