Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array `nums`.
- The double result is the maximum score achievable by partitioning the array `nums` into at most `k` non-empty adjacent subarrays.
- The score is the sum of the averages of each subarray.
- The partition must use every integer in the array `nums`.
- The score is not necessarily an integer.
- The answer will be accepted if it is within 10^-6 of the actual answer.
