- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have equal length `n`.
- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be 0-indexed.
- The integer result is the minimum total cost of performing the swap operation any number of times such that `nums1[i] != nums2[i]` for all `0 <= i <= n - 1`.
- If it is not possible to satisfy the condition `nums1[i] != nums2[i]` for all `0 <= i <= n - 1` after performing all the operations, the result is equal to -1.
