- The integer array parameters `nums1` and `nums2` must have equal length `n`.
- The integer result is the minimum total cost of performing the swap operations such that `nums1[i] != nums2[i]` for all `0 <= i <= n - 1`.
- If it is not possible to satisfy the condition `nums1[i] != nums2[i]` for all `0 <= i <= n - 1`, the result is -1.
