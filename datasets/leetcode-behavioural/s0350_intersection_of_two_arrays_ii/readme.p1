- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums2` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums2` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the number of elements that are common in both `nums1` and `nums2`.
- Each element in the integer array result appears as many times as it shows in both `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The order of elements in the integer array result may vary.
- The integer array result may contain duplicate elements if they appear multiple times in both `nums1` and `nums2`.
