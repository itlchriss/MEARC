- The integer array parameter `arr` contains unique integers that are either 1 or prime numbers.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the total number of possible fractions that can be formed from the elements of `arr`.
- The integer array result is of size 2, where `result[0]` is equal to one of the elements in `arr` and `result[1]` is equal to another element in `arr`.
- The fractions to be considered are formed by dividing the elements of `arr` in all possible combinations.
- The `k`-th smallest fraction is returned as the result.
