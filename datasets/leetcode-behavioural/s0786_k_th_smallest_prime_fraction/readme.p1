- The integer array parameter `arr` contains unique integers that are either 1 or prime numbers.
- The integer array parameter `arr` is sorted in strictly increasing order.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the total number of fractions that can be formed from the elements of `arr`.
- The integer array result is of size 2, where the first element is an element from `arr[i]` and the second element is an element from `arr[j]`.
- The fractions to be considered are formed by dividing the elements of `arr` in sorted order.
- The k-th smallest fraction considered is returned as the result.
