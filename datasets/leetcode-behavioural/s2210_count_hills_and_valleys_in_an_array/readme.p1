Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer array parameter `nums` contains elements greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer result is the number of hills and valleys in the integer array `nums`.
- An index `i` is part of a hill if the closest non-equal neighbors of `i` are smaller than `nums[i]`.
- An index `i` is part of a valley if the closest non-equal neighbors of `i` are larger than `nums[i]`.
- Adjacent indices `i` and `j` are part of the same hill or valley if `nums[i] == nums[j]`.
