- The integer array parameter `citations` is sorted in ascending order.
- The integer result is the researcher's `h-index`.
- The integer result is the maximum value of `h` such that `h` of the researcher's papers have at least `h` citations each, and the remaining papers have no more than `h` citations each.
- The algorithm must run in logarithmic time.
