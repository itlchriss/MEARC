- The integer array parameter `citations` is sorted in ascending order.
- The integer result is the researcher's `h-index`.
- The researcher's `h-index` is the maximum value of `h` such that `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n - h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.
- The algorithm must run in logarithmic time.
