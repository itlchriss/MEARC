- The integer array parameter `buildings` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `buildings` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10000.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `buildings` must be an array of length 3, where the first element represents the x coordinate of the left edge of the building, the second element represents the x coordinate of the right edge of the building, and the third element represents the height of the building.
- The integer result is a list of key points sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...] representing the skyline formed by the buildings collectively.
- Each key point in the result list is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point, which always has a y-coordinate of 0 to mark the skyline's termination.
- There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline.
