- The integer parameter `low` is greater than 0 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `high` is greater than or equal to the integer parameter `low` and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than 0 and is less than or equal to 20.
- The integer result is the number of beautiful integers in the range `[low, high]`.
- A number is considered beautiful if it meets both conditions: 
    - The count of even digits in the number is equal to the count of odd digits.
    - The number is divisible by `k`.
- The beautiful integers in the range `[low, high]` are inclusive.
- The output should be the count of beautiful integers within the specified range.
