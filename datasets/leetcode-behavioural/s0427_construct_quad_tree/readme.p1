- The Quad-Tree node `val` attribute can be assigned either True or False when `isLeaf` is False.
- The Quad-Tree node `isLeaf` attribute can be assigned either True or False.
- If the current grid has the same value (all 1's or all 0's), the Quad-Tree node `isLeaf` attribute is True and the `val` attribute is set to the value of the grid. The four children of the node are set to Null.
- If the current grid has different values, the Quad-Tree node `isLeaf` attribute is False and the `val` attribute can be set to any value. The current grid is divided into four sub-grids.
- Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.
- The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
- The node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]` where True is represented as 1 and False is represented as 0.
