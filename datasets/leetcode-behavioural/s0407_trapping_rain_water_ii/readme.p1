Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer matrix parameter `heightMap` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `heightMap` must have dimensions `m x n` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- The integer result is the volume of water trapped after raining in the 2D elevation map represented by the integer matrix parameter `heightMap`.
- The volume of water trapped is calculated based on the height of each unit cell in the integer matrix parameter `heightMap`.
- The volume of water trapped is the total sum of water trapped between the blocks in the 2D elevation map.
