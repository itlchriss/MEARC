- The integer parameter `num1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^22.
- The integer parameter `num2` is greater than or equal to `num1` and is less than or equal to 10^22.
- The integer parameters `min_sum` and `max_sum` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 400.
- The integer result is the number of integers `x` such that `num1 <= x <= num2` and `min_sum <= digit_sum(x) <= max_sum`.
- The integer result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
