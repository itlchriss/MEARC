- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000.
- The 2D list result contains prime number pairs [x, y] where 1 <= x <= y <= n and x + y equals n.
- The prime number pairs in the result list are sorted in increasing order of x.
- If there are no prime number pairs that satisfy the criteria, an empty list is returned.
