- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000.
- The 2D list result contains prime number pairs `[xi, yi]` where `1 <= xi <= yi <= n` and `xi + yi == n`.
- The prime number pairs in the result list are sorted in increasing order of xi.
- If there are no prime number pairs that satisfy the criteria, an empty list is returned.
