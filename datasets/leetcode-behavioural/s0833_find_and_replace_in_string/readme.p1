- If the substring `sources[i]` occurs at index `indices[i]` in the original string `s`, replace that substring with `targets[i] in the resulting string.
- If the substring `sources[i]` does not occur at index `indices[i]` in the original string `s`, do not make any changes to the resulting string.
- All replacement operations must occur simultaneously and should not affect the indexing of each other.
- The resulting string after performing all replacement operations on `s` is returned.
- The resulting string should consist of only lowercase English letters.
- The length of the resulting string is less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of `sources[i]` and `targets[i]` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The number of replacement operations `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The indices in the `indices` array are valid indexes within the original string `s`.
