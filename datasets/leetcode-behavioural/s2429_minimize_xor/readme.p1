- The integer parameter `num1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `num2` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the positive integer `x` such that `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and the value `x XOR num1` is minimal.
- The number of set bits of an integer is the number of `1`'s in its binary representation.
