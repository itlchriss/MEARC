- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of bit flips required in some bits of integers `a` and `b` to make the bitwise OR operation of `a` and `b` equal to `c`.
- The result is equal to 0 if no bit flips are required to satisfy the condition.
- The result is greater than 0 if bit flips are required to satisfy the condition.
