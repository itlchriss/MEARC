- The string parameter `word1` and the string parameter `word2` must not be null.
- The integer result is the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed by choosing non-empty subsequences from `word1` and `word2` and concatenating them.
- If no palindromes can be constructed, the integer result is 0.
