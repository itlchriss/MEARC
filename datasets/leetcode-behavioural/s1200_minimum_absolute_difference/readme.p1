- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `arr` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are distinct.
- The integer array result is a list of pairs in ascending order.
- Each pair `[a, b]` in the result list follows:
    - `a` and `b` are from the `arr`.
    - `a` is less than `b`.
    - The absolute difference between `b` and `a` is equal to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in `arr`.
