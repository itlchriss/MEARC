- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.
- The integer result is the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits as the integer parameter `n` and is greater in value than `n`.
- If no such positive integer exists, the result is equal to -1.
- The returned integer should fit in a 32-bit integer, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in a 32-bit integer, the result is equal to -1.
