- The integer parameter `n` must be a positive integer.
- The integer result is the smallest integer that has exactly the same digits as the integer parameter `n` and is greater in value than `n`.
- If no such positive integer exists, the integer result is -1.
- The returned integer should fit in a 32-bit integer, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in a 32-bit integer, the integer result is -1.
