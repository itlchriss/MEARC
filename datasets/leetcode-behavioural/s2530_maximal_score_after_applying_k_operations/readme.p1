- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The long result is the maximum possible score after applying exactly `k` operations.
- In each operation, the score is increased by the value at the selected index in the `nums` array, and the value at that index is replaced with the ceiling of the value divided by 3.
