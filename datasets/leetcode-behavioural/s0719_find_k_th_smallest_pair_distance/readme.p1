- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the total number of pairs possible in the `nums` array.
- The integer result is the `k`-th smallest distance among all pairs of integers in the `nums` array.
- The distance of a pair of integers `a` and `b` is defined as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
- The result must be calculated by finding all possible pairs of integers in the `nums` array and then sorting the distances in ascending order to find the `k`-th smallest distance.
