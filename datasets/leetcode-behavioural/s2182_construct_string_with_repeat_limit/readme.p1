- The string parameter `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- The integer parameter `repeatLimit` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of string `s`.
- The string result `repeatLimitedString` is constructed using characters from string `s` such that no letter appears more than `repeatLimit` times in a row.
- The string result `repeatLimitedString` is the lexicographically largest possible string that satisfies the repeat limit constraint.
- If there are multiple valid `repeatLimitedString` that are lexicographically largest, return any of them.
