- The integer parameter `n` is even.
- The string parameter `s` consists of exactly `n / 2` opening brackets '[' and `n / 2` closing brackets ']'.
- The string parameter `s` is balanced if it can be written as 'AB' where both A and B are balanced strings, or it can be written as '[C]' where C is a balanced string.
- The method must return the minimum number of swaps required to make the string `s` balanced.
