- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is between 3 and 7.
- All integers in the integer matrix parameter `grid` must be unique and within the range `[0, n * n - 1]`.
- The boolean result is true if the integer matrix parameter `grid` represents a valid configuration of the knight's movements, and false otherwise.
- A valid knight move consists of moving two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.
- The knight starts at the top-left cell of the board and visits every cell on the board exactly once.
