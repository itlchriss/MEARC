- The string parameter `n` represents a very large integer and is in the range of [1, 9].
- The integer parameter `x` is in the range of [1, 9].
- The string parameter `n` may represent a negative number, but `x` cannot be inserted to the left of the negative sign.
- The method returns a string representing the maximum value of `n` after inserting `x` anywhere in the decimal representation of `n`.
- The method must handle cases where multiple insertions of `x` can result in different maximum values of `n`.
- The method must handle cases where inserting `x` at different positions in `n` can result in the same maximum value.
- The method must handle cases where the maximum value of `n` after inserting `x` is negative.
- The method must handle cases where the length of the string parameter `n` is within the range of [1, 100000].
- The method must handle cases where the integer parameter `x` is within the range of [1, 9].
- The method must handle cases where the digits in the string parameter `n` are within the range of [1, 9].
- The method must handle cases where the string parameter `n` is a valid representation of an integer.
