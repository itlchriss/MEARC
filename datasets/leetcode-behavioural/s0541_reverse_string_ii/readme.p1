- The string parameter `s` is reversed for the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.
- If there are fewer than `k` characters left, all remaining characters are reversed.
- If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters left, the first `k` characters are reversed and the remaining characters are left unchanged.
