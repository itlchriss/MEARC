- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The length of the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The string result is obtained by reversing the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.
- If there are fewer than `k` characters left, all of them are reversed.
- If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, the first `k` characters are reversed, and the rest are left unchanged.
