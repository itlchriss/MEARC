- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the integer array result `avgs` is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- If there are less than `k` elements before or after the index `i`, the k-radius average for that subarray is -1.
- The k-radius average for a subarray of `nums` centered at some index `i` with the radius `k` is the average of all elements in `nums` between the indices `i - k` and `i + k` (inclusive).
- The average of `x` elements is the sum of the `x` elements divided by `x`, using integer division.
- The integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.
