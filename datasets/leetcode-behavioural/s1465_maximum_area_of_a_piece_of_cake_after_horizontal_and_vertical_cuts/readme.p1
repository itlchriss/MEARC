- The integer parameter `h` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `w` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The length of the integer array parameter `horizontalCuts` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of `h - 1` and 10^5.
- The length of the integer array parameter `verticalCuts` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of `w - 1` and 10^5.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `horizontalCuts` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than `h`.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `verticalCuts` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than `w`.
- All elements in the integer array parameter `horizontalCuts` are distinct.
- All elements in the integer array parameter `verticalCuts` are distinct.
- The integer result is the maximum area of a piece of cake after cutting at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`, modulo 10^9 + 7.
