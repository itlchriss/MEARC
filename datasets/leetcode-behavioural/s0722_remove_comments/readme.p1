Method behavioural specifications:
- If the string `"//"` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
- If the string `"/*"` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.
- Each string in the output list will be non-empty.
- Implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.
- The output format should be the same as the input format, with each line of code separated by newline characters.
- Every open block comment will eventually be closed.
- The output list should not contain any control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.
