- The integer array parameter `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array `arr`.
- The integer parameter `x` is greater than or equal to -10000 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer collection result contains `k` closest integers to `x` in the integer array `arr`.
- If two integers have the same absolute difference from `x`, the integer closer to `x` is selected.
- The integer collection result is sorted in ascending order.
