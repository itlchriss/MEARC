- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 58.
- The integer result is the maximum product of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n`.
- The number of positive integers `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- The positive integers that sum up to `n` must be maximized to achieve the maximum product.
- The product of the positive integers must be maximized to achieve the maximum product.
