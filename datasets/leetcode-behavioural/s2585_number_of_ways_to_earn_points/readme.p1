- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer array parameter `types` has a length `n` where `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- Each element in the integer array `types` is a 2-element array `[count, marks]` where `count` and `marks` are both greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50.
