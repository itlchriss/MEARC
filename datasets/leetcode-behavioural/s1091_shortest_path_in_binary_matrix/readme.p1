Method behavioural requirements:
- If there is a clear path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in the binary matrix `grid`, the integer result is the length of the shortest clear path.
- If there is no clear path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in the binary matrix `grid`, the integer result is -1.
