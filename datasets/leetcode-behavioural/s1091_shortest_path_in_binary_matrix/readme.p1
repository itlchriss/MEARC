- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a square matrix (i.e., number of rows equals number of columns).
- The integer result is the length of the shortest clear path in the binary matrix `grid`.
- If there is no clear path in the binary matrix `grid`, the integer result is equal to -1.
- A clear path in the binary matrix `grid` is a path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell where all visited cells are 0 and all adjacent cells are 8-directionally connected.
- The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells in the path.
