- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the length of the array prefix of `nums` such that it is possible to remove exactly one element from this prefix so that every number that has appeared in it will have the same number of occurrences.
- If after removing one element there are no remaining elements, it is still considered that every appeared number has the same number of occurrences (0).
