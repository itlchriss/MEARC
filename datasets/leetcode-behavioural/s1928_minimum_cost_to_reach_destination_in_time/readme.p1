- The integer parameter `maxTime` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer array parameter `passingFees` contains passing fees for each city and has a length equal to the number of cities `n`.
- The 2D integer array parameter `edges` represents the roads between cities, where each row `[x_i, y_i, time_i]` denotes a road between cities `x_i` and `y_i` that takes `time_i` minutes to travel.
- The integer result is the minimum cost to complete the journey from city 0 to city `n - 1` within `maxTime` minutes, considering passing fees and travel times.
- If it is impossible to complete the journey within `maxTime` minutes, the result is -1.
