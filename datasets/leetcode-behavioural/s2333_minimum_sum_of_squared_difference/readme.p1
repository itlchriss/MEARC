- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be of the same length `n`.
- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must contain only positive integers.
- The integer parameters `k1` and `k2` must be positive integers.
- The integer result is the minimum sum of squared difference after modifying array `nums1` at most `k1` times and modifying array `nums2` at most `k2` times.
- The elements in `nums1` and `nums2` can be modified by `+1` or `-1` at most `k1` and `k2` times respectively.
- The sum of squared difference is calculated as the sum of `(nums1[i] - nums2[i])^2` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The elements in `nums1` and `nums2` can be modified to become negative integers.
- The minimum sum of squared difference is the smallest possible value that can be achieved after the allowed modifications.
