- The integer parameter `i` is the node number.
- The integer parameter `time` is the time taken to travel to the node.
- The integer result is the maximum quality of a valid path in the graph.
- The integer result is the sum of the values of the unique nodes visited in the path.
- Each node's value is added at most once to the sum.
- The total time taken to complete the path is at most `maxTime`.
- The nodes visited in the path are unique.
- There are at most four edges connected to each node.
