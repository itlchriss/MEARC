- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length must be an even number.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer array result is the decompressed list generated by concatenating sublists based on the adjacent pairs of elements in the `nums` array.
- For each adjacent pair `[freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]`, there are `freq` elements with value `val` concatenated in a sublist.
- The decompressed list is generated by concatenating all the sublists from left to right.
