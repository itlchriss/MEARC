- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` must be an even number.
- The integer array result is the decompressed list generated by concatenating sublists based on the adjacent pairs of elements in the input array `nums`.
- Each adjacent pair `[freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]` in the input array `nums` represents `freq` elements with value `val` to be concatenated in a sublist.
- The integer array result is generated by concatenating all sublists from left to right.
- The values in the integer array result are the values from the sublists generated based on the adjacent pairs in the input array `nums`.
