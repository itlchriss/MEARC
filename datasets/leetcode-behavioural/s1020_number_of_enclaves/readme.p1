- The integer matrix parameter `a` represents a binary matrix where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.
- The integer result is the number of land cells in the grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.
- The length of the integer matrix parameter `a` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500 for both dimensions.
- All values in the integer matrix parameter `a` are either 0 or 1.
