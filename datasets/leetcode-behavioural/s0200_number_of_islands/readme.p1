- The integer result is the number of islands in the 2D binary grid `grid`.
- An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
- All four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
- The input grid is represented as a 2D array of characters.
- The characters in the grid are either '1' (land) or '0' (water).
- The grid has a height of `m` and a width of `n`, where `1 <= m, n <= 300`.
- The grid is surrounded by water on all four edges.
- Islands are formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
- The number of islands is the count of separate land masses in the grid.
