- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the product of the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
- The integer result is the k<sup>th</sup> largest XOR coordinate value in the matrix.
- The XOR coordinate value of a coordinate (a, b) is the result of XORing all matrix elements within the rectangle defined by (0, 0) as the top-left corner and (a, b) as the bottom-right corner.
- The matrix elements are indexed starting from 0.
- The matrix dimensions are between 1 and 1000 for both rows and columns.
- The matrix elements are non-negative integers between 0 and 10<sup>6</sup>.
