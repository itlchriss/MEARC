- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the product of the number of rows and columns in the 2D `matrix`.
- The integer result is the `k`th largest XOR coordinate value of all coordinates in the `matrix`.
- The XOR value of a coordinate `(a, b)` is calculated by XORing all elements in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(a, b)` inclusive.
- The coordinates are 0-indexed.
- The coordinates are considered in row-major order.
- The XOR value of a coordinate `(a, b)` is the result of XORing all elements in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(a, b)` inclusive.
- The XOR value of a coordinate `(a, b)` is the XOR of all elements in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(a, b)` inclusive.
- The XOR value of a coordinate `(a, b)` is the result of XORing all elements in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(a, b)` inclusive.
- The XOR value of a coordinate `(a, b)` is the XOR of all elements in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(a, b)` inclusive.
