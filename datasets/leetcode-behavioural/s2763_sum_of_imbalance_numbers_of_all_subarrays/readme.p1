Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the sum of imbalance numbers of all subarrays of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The sum of imbalance numbers is calculated as the number of indices in the sorted version of the array such that the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1.
- The sum of imbalance numbers is calculated for all non-empty contiguous subarrays within the array.
