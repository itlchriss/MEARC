- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `queries` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer array result is a 2D matrix representing the updated `mat` after performing every query.
- For each query in the 2D integer array parameter `queries`, add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (row1, col1) and the bottom right corner (row2, col2).
- The top left corner coordinates (row1, col1) and the bottom right corner coordinates (row2, col2) are inclusive.
- The values of row1, col1, row2, and col2 in each query are within the bounds of the matrix `mat`.
- The updated values in the matrix `mat` after each query are correctly calculated and reflected in the result matrix.
