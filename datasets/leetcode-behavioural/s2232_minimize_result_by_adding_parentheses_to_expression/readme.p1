- The string parameter `expression` must be of the form "<num1>+<num2>", where <num1> and <num2> represent positive integers.
- After adding a pair of parentheses to the `expression`, the resulting expression must be a valid mathematical expression.
- The resulting expression after adding parentheses must evaluate to the smallest possible value.
- The left parenthesis must be added to the left of '+' and the right parenthesis must be added to the right of '+'.
- If there are multiple valid answers that yield the same result, any of them can be returned.
- The original value of the `expression`, and the value of the `expression` after adding any pair of parentheses that meets the requirements, must fit within a signed 32-bit integer.
