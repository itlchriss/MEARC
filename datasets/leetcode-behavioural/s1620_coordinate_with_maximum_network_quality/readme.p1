- The integer array parameter `towers` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `towers` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `towers` is an array of length 3 containing integral coordinates and quality factor.
- The integer parameter `radius` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The integer array result is of length 2 representing the integral coordinate with the maximum network quality.
- The network quality at a coordinate is calculated using the given formula.
- The lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate is returned if there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality.
