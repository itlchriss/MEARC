ensures:
- The returned type_array keyword_result is not null.
- The length of keyword_result is equal to param_n.
- Each element in keyword_result is an type_integer.
- The values in keyword_result are either non-negative integers or -1.
requires:
- The type_integer param_n is gtoet 1.
- The type_arrays param_redEdges and param_blueEdges are not null.
- The length of param_redEdges is not gt 400.
- The length of param_blueEdges is not gt 400.
- Each element in param_redEdges is a 2-length type_array.
- Each element in param_blueEdges is a 2-length type_array.
- The values in param_redEdges and param_blueEdges are in the range of 0 to `n-1`.
