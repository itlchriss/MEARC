Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 15.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -100 and less than or equal to 100.
- The result is a list of lists containing all different possible increasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements.
- Two equal integers in the array should be considered a special case of an increasing sequence.
- The order of the subsequences in the result list can be arbitrary.
