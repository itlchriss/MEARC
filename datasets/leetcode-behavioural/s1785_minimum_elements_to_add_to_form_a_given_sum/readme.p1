- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `limit` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to -limit and less than or equal to limit.
- The integer parameter `goal` must be greater than or equal to -1000000000 and less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of elements needed to add to the array `nums` to make the sum equal to `goal`.
- The sum of the array after adding the elements must maintain the property that `abs(nums[i]) <= limit`.
