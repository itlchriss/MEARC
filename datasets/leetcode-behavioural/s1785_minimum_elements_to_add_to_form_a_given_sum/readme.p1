- The integer array parameter `nums` has a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `limit` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -limit and less than or equal to limit.
- The integer parameter `goal` is greater than or equal to -1000000000 and less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of elements needed to add to the array `nums` to make the sum equal to `goal`.
- The array `nums` must maintain its property that the absolute value of each element is less than or equal to `limit`.
