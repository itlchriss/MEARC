- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 30.
- The string result is the `nth` term of the count-and-say sequence.
- The count-and-say sequence is defined by the recursive formula provided.
- The count-and-say sequence splits the digit string into the minimal number of groups where each group consists of contiguous sections of the same character.
- For each group in the count-and-say sequence, the number of characters is said followed by the character itself.
- The saying is converted into a digit string by replacing the counts with numbers and concatenating every saying.
- The output follows the examples provided in the business requirement.
