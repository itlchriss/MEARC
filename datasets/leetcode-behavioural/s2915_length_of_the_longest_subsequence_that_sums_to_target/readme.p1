- The integer list parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer list parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer list parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` that sums up to `target`.
- If no subsequence exists that sums up to `target`, the integer result is -1.
