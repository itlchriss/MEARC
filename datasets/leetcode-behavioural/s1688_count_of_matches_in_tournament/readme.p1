- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 200.
- If the integer parameter `n` is even, the integer result is the sum of `n / 2` and all the previous results until `n` becomes 2.
- If the integer parameter `n` is odd, the integer result is the sum of `(n - 1) / 2` and all the previous results until `n` becomes 1.
