- The boolean result is true if all the rectangles in the `rectangles` array together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
- The boolean result is false if there is a gap between the rectangular regions, if there is a gap in the top center, or if two rectangles overlap with each other.
- The length of the `rectangles` array is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20000.
- Each element in the `rectangles` array is an array of length 4.
- The values in each rectangle array represent the bottom-left point coordinates `(x, y)` and the top-right point coordinates `(a, b)` of the rectangle.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` in each rectangle array are greater than or equal to -100000 and are less than or equal to 100000.
