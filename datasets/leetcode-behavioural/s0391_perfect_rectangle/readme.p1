- The integer array parameter `rectangles` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `rectangles` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20000.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `rectangles` has a length of 4.
- The integer array parameter `rectangles` represents an axis-aligned rectangle where each element is in the format `[x, y, a, b]` where `(x, y)` is the bottom-left point and `(a, b)` is the top-right point of the rectangle.
- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if all the rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if there is a gap between the rectangular regions, a gap in the top center, or if two rectangles overlap with each other.
