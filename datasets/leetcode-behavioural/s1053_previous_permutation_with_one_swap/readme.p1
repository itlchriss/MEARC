- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `arr` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer array result is the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than the integer array parameter `arr` and can be made with exactly one swap.
- If it is not possible to create a permutation with exactly one swap that is smaller than the integer array parameter `arr`, the result is the same as the input array `arr`.
