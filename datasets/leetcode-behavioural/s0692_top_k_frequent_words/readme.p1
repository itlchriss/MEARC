- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The length of the string array parameter `words` is less than or equal to 500.
- All strings in the string array parameter `words` consist of lowercase English letters.
- The integer result is a list of strings containing the `k` most frequent words.
- The result is sorted by frequency from highest to lowest.
- Words with the same frequency are sorted by lexicographical order.
- The result list does not contain duplicates.
- The result list has a length less than or equal to the number of unique words in the input array.
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n log(k)), and the space complexity is O(n).
