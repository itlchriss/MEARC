- The integer array parameter `stations` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `stations` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `stations` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `r` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `stations` minus 1.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The long result is the maximum possible minimum power of a city after building `k` additional power stations optimally.
