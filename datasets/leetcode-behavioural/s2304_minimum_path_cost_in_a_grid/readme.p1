- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a 0-indexed `m x n` matrix consisting of distinct integers from `0` to `m * n - 1`.
- The integer matrix parameter `moveCost` must be a 0-indexed 2D array of size `(m * n) x n`, where `moveCost[i][j]` represents the cost of moving from a cell with value `i` to a cell in column `j` of the next row.
- The integer result is the minimum cost of a path that starts from any cell in the first row and ends at any cell in the last row.
- The total cost of a path is the sum of all values of cells visited plus the sum of costs of all the moves made.
- The path with the minimum possible cost must be determined based on the given grid and moveCost.
- The result must be calculated based on the values in the grid, the moveCost matrix, and the costs associated with moving between cells.
- The constraints on the input parameters must be strictly adhered to.
