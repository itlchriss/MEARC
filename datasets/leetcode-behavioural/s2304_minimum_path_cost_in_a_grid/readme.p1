Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` is a 0-indexed matrix consisting of distinct integers from 0 to m * n - 1.
- The integer matrix parameter `moveCost` is a 0-indexed 2D array of size (m * n) x n, where moveCost[i][j] represents the cost of moving from a cell with value i to a cell in column j of the next row.
- The cost of a path in the grid is the sum of all values of cells visited plus the sum of costs of all the moves made.
- The method returns the minimum cost of a path that starts from any cell in the first row and ends at any cell in the last row.
