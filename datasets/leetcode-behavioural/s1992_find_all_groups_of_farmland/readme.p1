- The integer matrix parameter `land` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `land` must be a 0-indexed `m x n` binary matrix.
- The integer matrix result is a 2D array containing 4-length arrays for each group of farmland in the `land` matrix.
- Each 4-length array represents a group of farmland with top left and bottom right coordinates.
- If there are no groups of farmland, the result is an empty array.
- The top left corner coordinates are represented by the first two elements in the 4-length array.
- The bottom right corner coordinates are represented by the last two elements in the 4-length array.
