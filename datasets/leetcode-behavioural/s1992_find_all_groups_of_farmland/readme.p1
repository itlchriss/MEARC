- The integer matrix parameter `land` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `land` must be a 0-indexed `m x n` binary matrix.
- The integer matrix result is a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays representing the top left and bottom right corners of each group of farmland in the `land` matrix.
- If there are no groups of farmland, the result is an empty array.
- Each group of farmland is represented by a 4-length array `[r1, c1, r2, c2]` where `r1` and `c1` are the coordinates of the top left corner and `r2` and `c2` are the coordinates of the bottom right corner.
- The result can be returned in any order.
