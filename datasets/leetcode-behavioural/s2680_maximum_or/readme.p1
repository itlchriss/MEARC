- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 15.
- The long result is the maximum possible value of `nums[0] | nums[1] | ... | nums[n - 1]` that can be obtained after applying the operation on `nums` at most `k` times.
