- The integer parameter `numCarpets` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `carpetLen` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the string `floor`.
- The string parameter `floor` consists of binary characters '0' and '1'.
- The integer result is the minimum number of white tiles still visible after covering the floor with the given carpets.
- The result is achieved by covering the tiles with the carpets in a way that minimizes the number of white tiles visible.
- Carpets may overlap each other during the covering process.
- The result is calculated based on the optimal arrangement of carpets to cover the floor with the least number of white tiles visible.
