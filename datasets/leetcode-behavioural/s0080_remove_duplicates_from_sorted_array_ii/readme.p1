- The integer array parameter `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The integer result is the number of unique elements in the array `nums` after removing duplicates such that each unique element appears at most twice.
- The relative order of the elements in the array `nums` should be kept the same.
- The first `k` elements of the array `nums` should hold the final result after removing duplicates.
- The length of the integer array `nums` does not change, and the final result is placed in the first `k` slots of the array `nums`.
- The integer result `k` is equal to the number of elements in the array `nums` after removing duplicates.
- The integer result `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 30000.
- The integer result `k` is equal to the length of the expected answer with correct length.
- The values of the first `k` elements in the array `nums` are equal to the values of the expected answer with correct length.
