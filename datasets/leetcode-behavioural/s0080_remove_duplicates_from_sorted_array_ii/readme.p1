- The integer result `k` represents the number of unique elements in the array `nums` after removing duplicates such that each unique element appears at most twice.
- The relative order of the elements in the array `nums` should be kept the same.
- The first `k` elements of the array `nums` should hold the final result.
- The remaining elements beyond the first `k` elements in the array `nums` are not specified.
