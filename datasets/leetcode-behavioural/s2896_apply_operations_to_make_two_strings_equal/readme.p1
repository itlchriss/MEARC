- The integer parameter `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- The length of the binary string parameters `s1` and `s2` is equal.
- The binary strings `s1` and `s2` consist only of the characters '0' and '1'.
- The integer result is the minimum cost needed to make the binary strings `s1` and `s2` equal.
- If it is impossible to make the two strings equal, the integer result is -1.
