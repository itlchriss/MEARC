- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 200000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is less than or equal to 200000.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The integer values in each element of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to `n - 1`.
- The integer parameters `start` and `end` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to `n - 1`.
- The boolean result is true if there is a valid path from the vertex `start` to the vertex `end`, otherwise false.
