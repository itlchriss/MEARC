- The integer array parameter `deck` must not be null.
- The integer array result is an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.
- The first entry in the result is considered to be the top of the deck.
- After revealing each card, if there are still cards in the deck, the next top card is put at the bottom of the deck.
- The order of the deck before reordering does not matter.
