- The Node parameter `head` is not null.
- The Node parameter `head` contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer.
- The child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list.
- The child lists may have one or more children of their own.
- The flattened list should have all nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list.
- If a node `curr` has a child list, the nodes in the child list should appear after `curr` and before `curr.next` in the flattened list.
- The nodes in the flattened list must have all of their child pointers set to null.
