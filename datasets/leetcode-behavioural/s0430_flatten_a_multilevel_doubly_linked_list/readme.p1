Method behavioural requirements:
- The Node parameter `head` must not be null.
- The flattened list must contain all nodes in a single-level, doubly linked list.
- If a node `curr` has a child list, the nodes in the child list should appear after `curr` and before `curr.next` in the flattened list.
- All child pointers of the nodes in the flattened list must be set to null.
