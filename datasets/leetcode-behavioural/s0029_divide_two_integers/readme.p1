- The integer parameter `dividend` is within the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].
- The integer parameter `divisor` is within the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1] and is not equal to 0.
- The integer result is the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.
- The integer division truncates towards zero, meaning it loses its fractional part.
- If the quotient is strictly greater than 2^31 - 1, the result is 2^31 - 1.
- If the quotient is strictly less than -2^31, the result is -2^31.
