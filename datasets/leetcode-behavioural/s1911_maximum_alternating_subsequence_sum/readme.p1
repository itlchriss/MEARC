- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The long result is the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The elements of the subsequence must be reindexed.
- The subsequence is generated by deleting some elements without changing the relative order of the remaining elements.
- The maximum alternating sum is calculated as the sum of elements at even indices minus the sum of elements at odd indices.
