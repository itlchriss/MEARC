- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to -10^9 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `target` is not equal to 0.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination.
- The minimum number of moves is the minimum `numMoves` to reach the destination.
- On each move, the number of steps taken is equal to the move number.
- The direction of each move can be either left or right.
- The direction of the move is chosen by the sign of the step (positive for right, negative for left).
- The steps taken in each move are incremental, starting from 1 step in the first move.
- The steps taken in each move increase by 1 for each subsequent move.
- The steps taken in each move are cumulative, i.e., the total steps taken up to the `i`th move is the sum of the steps taken in all previous moves.
- The steps taken in each move can be in either direction (left or right).
- The steps taken in each move can be in the opposite direction of the previous move.
- The steps taken in each move can be in the same direction as the previous move.
- The steps taken in each move can be in the same direction as the previous move, but with a greater number of steps.
- The steps taken in each move can be in the opposite direction of the previous move, but with a greater number of steps.
