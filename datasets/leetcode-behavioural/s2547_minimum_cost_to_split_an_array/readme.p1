- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the minimum possible cost of splitting the integer array `nums`.
- The importance value of a subarray is calculated as `k + trimmed(subarray).length`.
- The trimmed version of a subarray is obtained by removing all numbers that appear only once in the subarray.
- The cost of a split is the sum of the importance values of each subarray in the split.
