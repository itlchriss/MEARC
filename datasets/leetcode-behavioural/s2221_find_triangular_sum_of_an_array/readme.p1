- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
- All elements in the integer array parameter `nums` must be digits between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
- The integer result is the value of the only element present in the integer array `nums` after the process terminates.
- The process terminates when the integer array `nums` has only one element left.
- In each iteration of the process, a new integer array `newNums` of length `n - 1` is created.
- For each index `i` in the range 0 to `n - 1`, the value of `newNums[i]` is calculated as `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10`.
- The array `nums` is then replaced with `newNums` and the process repeats until only one element is left in the array.
