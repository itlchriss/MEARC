- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations needed for the integer parameter `n` to become 1.
- If the integer parameter `n` is even, the integer result is equal to the number of times `n` can be divided by 2.
- If the integer parameter `n` is odd, the integer result is equal to the minimum number of operations needed to reach 1 by either adding 1 or subtracting 1 from `n`.
