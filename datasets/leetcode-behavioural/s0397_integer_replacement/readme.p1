- If the integer parameter `n` is even, the integer result is the minimum number of operations needed for `n` to become `1` by replacing `n` with `n / 2`.
- If the integer parameter `n` is odd, the integer result is the minimum number of operations needed for `n` to become `1` by replacing `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.
