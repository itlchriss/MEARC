- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a square matrix (n x n) where n is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 200.
- All elements in the integer matrix parameter `grid` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the number of pairs (Ri, Cj) where row Ri and column Cj are equal in the matrix `grid`.
- The result is a list of equal row and column pairs, where each pair is represented as (Row i, Column j): [elements in the row/column].
