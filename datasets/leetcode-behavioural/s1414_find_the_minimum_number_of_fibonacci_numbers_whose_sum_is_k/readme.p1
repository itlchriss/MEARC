- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to the integer parameter `k`.
- The Fibonacci numbers used to calculate the sum can be repeated multiple times.
- The Fibonacci numbers used for the sum must be from the Fibonacci sequence defined as F1 = 1, F2 = 1, and Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for n > 2.
- It is guaranteed that for the given constraints, there will always be a combination of Fibonacci numbers that sum up to `k`.
