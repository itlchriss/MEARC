- If the integer result is -1, the version number `version1` is less than the version number `version2`.
- If the integer result is 1, the version number `version1` is greater than the version number `version2`.
- If the integer result is 0, the version number `version1` is equal to the version number `version2`.
- The version numbers `version1` and `version2` consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'.
- Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros.
- Every revision contains at least one character.
- Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on.
- Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros.
- If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0.
