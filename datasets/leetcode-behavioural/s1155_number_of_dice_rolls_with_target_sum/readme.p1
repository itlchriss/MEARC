- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 30.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 30.
- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the number of possible ways to roll the dice so the sum of the face-up numbers equals `target`, modulo 10^9 + 7.
