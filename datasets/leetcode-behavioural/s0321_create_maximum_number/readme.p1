- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums2` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 9.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums2` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 9.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the integer parameter `k`.
- The relative order of the digits from the same array in the result is preserved.
