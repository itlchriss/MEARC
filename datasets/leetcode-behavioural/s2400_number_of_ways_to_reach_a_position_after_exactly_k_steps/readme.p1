- The integer parameter `startPos` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `endPos` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the number of different ways to reach the position `endPos` starting from `startPos` with exactly `k` steps.
- The integer result is modulo 10^9 + 7.
