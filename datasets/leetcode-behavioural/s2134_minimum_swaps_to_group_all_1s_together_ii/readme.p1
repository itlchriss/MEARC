Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together at any location.
- The minimum number of swaps required is 0 if all the 1's are already grouped together due to the circular property of the array.
- The minimum number of swaps required is 1 if there is at least one way to group all the 1's together using 1 swap.
- The minimum number of swaps required is 2 if there is at least one way to group all the 1's together using 2 swaps.
- There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 swaps.
