- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` is an array of length 2 where the first element is less than the second element and both elements are between 0 and `n - 1`.
- The length of the boolean list parameter `hasApple` is equal to `n`.
- The boolean result is the minimum time in seconds to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.
