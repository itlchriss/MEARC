- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `requests` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `requests` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `requests` is an array of length 2.
- The integer values in each array of `requests` are such that the first value is less than or equal to the second value and both are less than the length of the `nums` array.
- The integer result is the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of `nums`, modulo 10^9 + 7.
