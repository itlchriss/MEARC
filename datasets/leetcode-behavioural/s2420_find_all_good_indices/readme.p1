- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to half the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The integer result is a list of all good indices sorted in increasing order.
- A good index `i` in the range `k <= i < n - k` satisfies the following conditions:
    - The `k` elements before index `i` are in non-increasing order.
    - The `k` elements after index `i` are in non-decreasing order.
