- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameters `lower` and `upper` must satisfy the condition `-10^5 <= lower <= upper <= 10^5`.
- The integer result is the number of range sums that lie in the inclusive range `[lower, upper]`.
- The range sum `S(i, j)` is the sum of elements in the `nums` array between indices `i` and `j` inclusive, where `i <= j`.
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
