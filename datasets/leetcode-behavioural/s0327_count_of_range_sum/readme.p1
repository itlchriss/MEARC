- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -2^31 and are less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.
- The integer parameters `lower` and `upper` are greater than or equal to -10^5 and are less than or equal to 10^5.
- The integer result is the number of range sums that lie in the inclusive range `[lower, upper]`.
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
