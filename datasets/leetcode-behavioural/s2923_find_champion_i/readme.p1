- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The 2D boolean matrix parameter `grid` has a size of `n * n`.
- For all `i, j` where `0 <= i, j <= n - 1` and `i != j`, if `grid[i][j] == 1`, then team `i` is stronger than team `j`.
- The integer result is the team that will be the champion of the tournament.
