- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a square matrix (n x n).
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must contain unique values.
- The integer result is the least time until reaching the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1) starting from the top left square (0, 0).
- The time starts at 0 and increases incrementally.
- At each time `t`, the depth of water everywhere is `t`.
- The swim is allowed from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square only if the elevation of both squares individually is at most `t`.
- The swim can cover infinite distances in zero time.
- The swim must stay within the boundaries of the grid during the swim.
