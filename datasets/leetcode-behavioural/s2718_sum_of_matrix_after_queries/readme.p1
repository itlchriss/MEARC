- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `queries` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50000.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `queries` has a length of 3.
- The integer values in the 2D integer array parameter `queries` satisfy the constraints: 0 <= type_i <= 1, 0 <= index_i < n, 0 <= val_i <= 100000.
- The integer result is the sum of integers in the matrix after all queries are applied.
