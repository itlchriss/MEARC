Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer matrix parameter `graph` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `initial` must not be null.
- The integer result is the node that, if removed, would minimize the final number of nodes infected with malware `M(initial)`.
- If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, the node with the smallest index is returned.
