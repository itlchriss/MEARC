- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 300.
- The integer parameter `graph` is an `n x n` adjacency matrix where `graph[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.
- The integer parameter `initial` is an array of integers representing initially infected nodes.
- The integer result is the node that, if removed, would minimize the final number of nodes infected with malware.
- If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize the final number of nodes infected with malware, the node with the smallest index should be returned.
