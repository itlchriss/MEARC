- The string parameter `str` is converted to a 32-bit signed integer.
- Leading whitespace characters in the string `str` are ignored.
- If the next character in the string `str` is '-' or '+', the result is negative or positive, respectively. If neither is present, the result is assumed to be positive.
- Only digits are considered for conversion into an integer. Any non-digit character encountered after reading digits is ignored.
- The integer value is clamped to the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1] if it exceeds this range.
- The final result is the converted integer value.
