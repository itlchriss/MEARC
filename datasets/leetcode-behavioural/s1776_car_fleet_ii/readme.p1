- The integer array parameter `cars` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `cars` must have a length between 1 and 10^5.
- The integer array parameter `cars` must contain subarrays of length 2, where the first element represents the position of the car and the second element represents the speed of the car.
- The position of each car in the integer array parameter `cars` must be in increasing order.
- The speed of each car in the integer array parameter `cars` must be between 1 and 10^6.
- For each car in the integer array parameter `cars`, the time at which it collides with the next car must be calculated and stored in the output array.
- If a car does not collide with the next car, the corresponding element in the output array must be -1.
- The output array must have the same length as the integer array parameter `cars`.
- The time values in the output array must be accurate within 10^-5 seconds.
