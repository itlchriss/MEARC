- The double array parameter `cars` must not be null.
- The length of the double array parameter `cars` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer array `cars[i]` is of length 2, where `cars[i][0]` represents the position of the `i-th` car and `cars[i][1]` represents the speed of the `i-th` car.
- The position of the `i-th` car is less than the position of the `i+1-th` car.
- The speed of the `i-th` car is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000.
- The double array result is of length equal to the length of the double array parameter `cars`.
- Each element in the double array result represents the time, in seconds, at which the `i-th` car collides with the next car, or -1 if the car does not collide with the next car.
- The time values in the double array result are within 10^-5 of the actual answers.
