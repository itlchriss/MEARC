- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is less than or equal to 100000.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 3.
- The integer parameters `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` are pairwise distinct and are greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`.
- The integer result is the minimum weight of a subgraph of the graph such that it is possible to reach `dest` from both `src1` and `src2` via a set of edges of this subgraph.
- If such a subgraph does not exist, the integer result is -1.
