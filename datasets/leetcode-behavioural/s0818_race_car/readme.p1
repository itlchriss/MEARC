- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to reach the target position.
- The sequence of instructions consists of 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse).
- When the instruction is 'A':
    - The position increases by the current speed.
    - The speed doubles.
- When the instruction is 'R':
    - If the speed is positive, it becomes -1.
    - If the speed is negative, it becomes 1.
- The position can be negative.
- The speed can be positive or negative.
