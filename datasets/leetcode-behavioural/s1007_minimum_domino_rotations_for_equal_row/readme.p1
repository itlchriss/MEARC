- If it is possible to rotate the dominoes to make all values in the `tops` array equal, the integer result is the minimum number of rotations required.
- If it is possible to rotate the dominoes to make all values in the `bottoms` array equal, the integer result is the minimum number of rotations required.
- If it is not possible to make all values in either the `tops` or `bottoms` array equal by rotating the dominoes, the integer result is -1.
