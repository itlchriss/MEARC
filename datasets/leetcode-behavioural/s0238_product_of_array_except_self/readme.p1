- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -30 and are less than or equal to 30.
- The integer array result is equal to the product of all elements of the integer array parameter `nums` except the element at index `i`.
- The product of any prefix or suffix of the integer array parameter `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
- The algorithm must run in O(n) time complexity.
- The algorithm must not use the division operation.
- The algorithm must solve the problem without using more than O(1) extra space.
