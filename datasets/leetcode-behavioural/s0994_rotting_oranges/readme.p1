- The integer 2 in the `grid` represents a rotten orange.
- The integer 1 in the `grid` represents a fresh orange.
- The integer 0 in the `grid` represents an empty cell.
- Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
- The method result is the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.
- If it is impossible for no cell to have a fresh orange, the method result is -1.
