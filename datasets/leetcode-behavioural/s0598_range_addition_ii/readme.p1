- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 40000.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 40000.
- The integer array parameter `ops` contains arrays of length 2.
- The integer array parameter `ops` may be empty.
- The integer array parameter `ops` contains elements where the first element is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `m`, and the second element is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer result is the number of maximum integers in the matrix `M` after performing all the operations specified in the `ops` array.
