- The string parameter `word1` and the string parameter `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- The string result `merge` is constructed by appending characters from `word1` and `word2` in a way that produces the lexicographically largest merge.
- The characters are appended in the order of the lexicographically largest choice available at each step.
- At each step, if both `word1` and `word2` are non-empty, the character chosen to append to `merge` is the one that results in the lexicographically largest merge.
- If `word1` is non-empty, the first character in `word1` is appended to `merge` and deleted from `word1`.
- If `word2` is non-empty, the first character in `word2` is appended to `merge` and deleted from `word2`.
- The process continues until both `word1` and `word2` are empty.
- The resulting `merge` string is the lexicographically largest merge that can be constructed from `word1` and `word2`.
