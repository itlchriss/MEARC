- If the string parameter `word1` is non-empty, append the first character in `word1` to the string result `merge` and delete it from `word1`.
- If the string parameter `word2` is non-empty, append the first character in `word2` to the string result `merge` and delete it from `word2`.
- The string result `merge` is the lexicographically largest merge that can be constructed from the strings `word1` and `word2`.
