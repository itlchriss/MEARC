- The integer list parameter `nums` contains `n` positive integers.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of `n * (n + 1) / 2` and `10^9`.
- The integer result is the maximum possible score after applying at most `k` operations.
- The result is returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.
- The operation involves choosing a non-empty subarray `nums[l, ..., r]` that hasn't been chosen previously.
- The element `x` with the highest prime score in the chosen subarray is selected. If multiple elements have the same highest prime score, the one with the smallest index is chosen.
- The score is multiplied by the selected element `x`.
- The maximum possible score is calculated based on the described operations.
