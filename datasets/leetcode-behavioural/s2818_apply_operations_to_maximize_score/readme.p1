- The integer list parameter `nums` contains `n` positive integers.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The integer result is the maximum possible score after applying at most `k` operations.
- The maximum possible score is calculated by choosing non-empty subarrays of `nums` and selecting an element with the highest prime score within the subarray.
- The prime score of an integer `x` is the number of distinct prime factors of `x`.
- The maximum possible score is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
