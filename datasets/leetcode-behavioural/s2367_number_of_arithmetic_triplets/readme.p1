- The integer parameter `diff` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The integer result is the number of unique arithmetic triplets in the integer array `nums`.
- An arithmetic triplet is defined as a triplet (i, j, k) where i < j < k, nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.
- The length of the integer array `nums` is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 200.
- All values in the integer array `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 200.
