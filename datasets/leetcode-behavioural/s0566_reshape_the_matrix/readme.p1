- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must have a length `m` and each row in the matrix must have a length `n`.
- The integer parameters `r` and `c` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 300.
- If the reshape operation with the given parameters is possible and legal, the integer matrix result is filled with all elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
- If the reshape operation with the given parameters is not possible or legal, the integer matrix result is the original matrix `mat`.
