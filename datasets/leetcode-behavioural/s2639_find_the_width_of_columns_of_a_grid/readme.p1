- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must have a length `m` and each row in the matrix must have a length `n`.
- The integer array result `ans` must have a size `n`.
- Each element in the integer array result `ans` is the width of the corresponding column in the integer matrix `grid`.
- The width of a column is defined as the maximum length of its integers.
- The length of an integer `x` with `len` digits is equal to `len` if `x` is non-negative, and `len + 1` otherwise.
