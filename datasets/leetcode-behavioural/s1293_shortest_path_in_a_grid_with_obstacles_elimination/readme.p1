- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- If it is possible to walk from the upper left corner to the lower right corner without eliminating any obstacles, the integer result is the minimum number of steps to achieve this.
- If it is possible to walk from the upper left corner to the lower right corner by eliminating at most `k` obstacles, the integer result is the minimum number of steps to achieve this.
- If it is not possible to find a walk from the upper left corner to the lower right corner by eliminating at most `k` obstacles, the integer result is -1.
