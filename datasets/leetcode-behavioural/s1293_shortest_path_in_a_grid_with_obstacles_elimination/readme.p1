- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must have a length `m` and each row in the matrix must have a length `n`.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `m * n`.
- The integer result is the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner to the lower right corner given that at most `k` obstacles can be eliminated.
- If it is not possible to find such a walk, the integer result is equal to -1.
