- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must have dimensions `m x n` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- Each cell in the integer matrix parameter `grid` must be either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle).
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the total number of obstacles in the grid.
- The integer result is the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)` given that you can eliminate at most `k` obstacles.
- If it is not possible to find such a walk, the integer result is -1.
