- The integer parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000000.
- The integer result is the difference between the maximum and minimum values that can be obtained by remapping exactly one digit in the integer parameter `num`.
- The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes.
- Danny can remap a digit to itself, in which case `num` does not change.
- Danny can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.
