Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if there exists a sequence of traversals between every pair of indices `i` and `j` in `nums` where `i < j`, such that `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`.
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if there does not exist a sequence of traversals between every pair of indices `i` and `j` in `nums` where `i < j`, such that `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`.
