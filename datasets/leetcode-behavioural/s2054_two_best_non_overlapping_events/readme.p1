- The integer 2D array parameter `events` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100000.
- Each element in the integer 2D array parameter `events` must have a length of 3.
- The integer values in the `events` array must satisfy the following constraints:
    - The start time `startTime_i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the end time `endTime_i`.
    - The end time `endTime_i` is greater than or equal to the start time `startTime_i` and less than or equal to 1000000000.
    - The value `value_i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer result is the maximum sum of values from attending at most two non-overlapping events.
- The start time and end time of events are inclusive, meaning you cannot attend two events where one ends and the other starts at the same time.
- If an event with end time `t` is attended, the next event must start at or after `t + 1`.
