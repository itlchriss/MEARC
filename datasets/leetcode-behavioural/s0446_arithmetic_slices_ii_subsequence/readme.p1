- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The integer result is the number of all arithmetic subsequences of the integer array `arr`.
- An arithmetic subsequence consists of at least three elements where the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
- The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
- The length of the integer array parameter `arr` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are greater than or equal to -2^31 and are less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.
