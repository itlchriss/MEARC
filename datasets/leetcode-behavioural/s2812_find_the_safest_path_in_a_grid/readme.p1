Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer result is the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to cell (n - 1, n - 1).
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 400.
- The integer parameter `grid` is a 2D matrix of size n x n.
- The cell containing a thief is represented by the integer 1 in the grid.
- The empty cell is represented by the integer 0 in the grid.
- An adjacent cell of cell (r, c) is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c), and (r - 1, c) if it exists.
- The Manhattan distance between two cells (a, b) and (x, y) is equal to |a - x| + |b - y|.
- The safeness factor of a path on the grid is defined as the minimum Manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.
