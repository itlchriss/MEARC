- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer 2D array parameter `paths` has a length `m` where `m` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The sum of the lengths of all integer arrays in the 2D array parameter `paths` is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer arrays in the 2D array parameter `paths` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than `n`.
- The integer result is the length of the longest common subpath shared by every path in the 2D array parameter `paths`.
- If there is no common subpath shared by all paths, the integer result is 0.
