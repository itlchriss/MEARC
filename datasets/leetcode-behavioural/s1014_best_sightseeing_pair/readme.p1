- The integer array parameter `values` must have a length greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 50000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `values` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots calculated as `values[i] + values[j] + i - j`, where `i` and `j` are indices of the sightseeing spots and `i < j`.
- The maximum score is achieved when the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots minus the distance between them is maximized.
- The length of the integer array result is 2.
- All values in the integer array result are unique.
