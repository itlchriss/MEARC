- The string parameter `s` must not be null.
- The length of the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the sum of the scores of every `s_i` where `1 <= i <= n`.
- The score of `s_i` is the length of the longest common prefix between `s_i` and `s_n`.
- The score of `s_i` is 0 if there is no common prefix between `s_i` and `s_n`.
- The score of `s_i` is equal to the length of the common prefix if there is a common prefix between `s_i` and `s_n`.
