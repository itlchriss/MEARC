- The string parameter `s` represents a valid mathematical expression.
- The integer result is the value of the evaluated expression represented by the string parameter `s`.
- The integer division in the expression truncates toward zero.
- All intermediate results during the evaluation of the expression will be within the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].
- The method does not use any built-in function that evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.
- The length of the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 3 * 10^5.
- The string parameter `s` consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
- All integers in the expression are non-negative integers within the range [0, 2^31 - 1].
- The answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
