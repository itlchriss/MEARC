- The string parameter `s` must not be null.
- The integer result is the value of the evaluated expression represented by the string parameter `s`.
- The integer division in the evaluated expression should truncate toward zero.
- The evaluated expression should be valid and all intermediate results should be in the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].
- The method should not use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.
