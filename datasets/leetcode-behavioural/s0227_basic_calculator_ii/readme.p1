- The string parameter `s` represents a valid mathematical expression.
- The integer result is the value of the evaluated expression.
- The integer division truncates towards zero.
- All intermediate results will be in the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].
- The method does not use any built-in function that evaluates strings as mathematical expressions.
- The length of the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 3 * 10^5.
- The expression in the string parameter `s` consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by spaces.
- All integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 2^31 - 1].
- The answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
