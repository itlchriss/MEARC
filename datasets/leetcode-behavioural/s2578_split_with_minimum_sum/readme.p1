- The integer parameter `number` is greater than or equal to 10 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the minimum possible sum of the two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` after splitting the integer parameter `number`.
- The concatenation of the two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` is a permutation of the integer parameter `number`.
- The sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in `num1` and `num2` is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in the integer parameter `number`.
- The non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros.
