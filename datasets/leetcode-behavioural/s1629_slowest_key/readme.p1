- The character result is the key of the keypress that had the longest duration.
- If there are multiple keypresses with the longest duration, the lexicographically largest key is returned.
- The integer array parameter `releaseTimes` and the string parameter `keysPressed` have the same length `n`.
- The integer array parameter `releaseTimes` is sorted in ascending order.
- The duration of the keypress is calculated as `releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1]` where `i` is the index of the keypress.
- The duration of the first keypress is `releaseTimes[0]`.
- The keypresses are associated with the characters in the string `keysPressed`.
- The keypress for each character in `keysPressed` corresponds to the duration calculated from `releaseTimes`.
- The keypress with the longest duration is determined by comparing the durations of all keypresses.
- If multiple keypresses have the longest duration, the lexicographically largest key is chosen as the result.
