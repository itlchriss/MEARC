- If it is possible to select two or more elements in the integer array parameter `nums` such that the bitwise OR of the selected elements has at least one trailing zero in its binary representation, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
- If it is not possible to select two or more elements in the integer array parameter `nums` such that the bitwise OR of the selected elements has at least one trailing zero in its binary representation, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
