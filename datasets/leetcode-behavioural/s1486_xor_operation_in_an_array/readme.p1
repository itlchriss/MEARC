- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The integer parameter `start` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the bitwise XOR of all elements in the array `nums` created as `nums[i] = start + 2 * i` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
