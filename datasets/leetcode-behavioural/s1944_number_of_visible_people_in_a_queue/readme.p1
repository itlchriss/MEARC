- Each element in the integer array result `answer` represents the number of people the corresponding person can see to their right in the queue.
- The `i`th person can see the `j`th person to their right if `i < j` and `min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])`.
- The values in the integer array result `answer` are calculated based on the visibility criteria mentioned above.
- The values in the integer array result `answer` are unique and correspond to the number of visible people to the right of each person in the queue.
