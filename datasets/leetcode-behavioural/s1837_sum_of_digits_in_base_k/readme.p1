- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 10.
- The integer result is the sum of the digits of `n` after converting `n` from base 10 to base `k`.
- After converting, each digit should be interpreted as a base 10 number.
- The sum should be returned in base 10.
