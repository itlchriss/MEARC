- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The size of the string list result is equal to the number of simplified fractions between 0 and 1 with denominators less-than-or-equal-to `n`.
- Each string in the list result represents a simplified fraction in the format "numerator/denominator".
- Fractions that can be further simplified should not be included in the result.
- The order of fractions in the result list can be arbitrary.
