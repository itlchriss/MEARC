- The integer array parameter `views` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `views` must be equal to the length of string arrays `creators` and `ids`.
- The string arrays `creators` and `ids` must not contain null values.
- The length of each string in the string arrays `creators` and `ids` must be between 1 and 5.
- The string values in the string arrays `creators` and `ids` must consist only of lowercase English letters.
- The integer values in the integer array parameter `views` must be between 0 and 100000.
- The result is a 2D list of strings where each inner list contains the creator with the highest popularity and the id of their most viewed video.
- If multiple creators have the highest popularity, all of them should be included in the result.
- If multiple videos have the highest view count for a creator, the lexicographically smallest id should be included in the result.
- The order of the output list can be arbitrary.
