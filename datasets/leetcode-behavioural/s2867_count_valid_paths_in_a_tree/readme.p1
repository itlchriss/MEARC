- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is an array of length 2 representing an edge between two nodes.
- The integer result is the number of valid paths in the tree.
- A valid path is a path where there exists exactly one prime number among the node labels in the path from one node to another.
- A path is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with one node and ending with another node where every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.
- Paths in both directions between two nodes are considered the same and counted only once.
