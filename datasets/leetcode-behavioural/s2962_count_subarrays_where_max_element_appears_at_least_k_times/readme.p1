- The integer array parameter `n` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `n` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `n` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The long result is the number of subarrays where the maximum element of the integer array `n` appears at least `k` times in that subarray.
