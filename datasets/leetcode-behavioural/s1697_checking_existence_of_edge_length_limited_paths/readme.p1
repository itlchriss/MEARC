- The integer parameter `n` in the constructor `Dsu(int n)` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `edgeList` in the method `CheckingExistenceOfEdgeLengthLimitedPaths` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `queries` in the method `CheckingExistenceOfEdgeLengthLimitedPaths` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer array parameter `edgeList` contains arrays of length 3 where each array represents an edge between two nodes with a distance.
- The integer array parameter `queries` contains arrays of length 3 where each array represents a query with two nodes and a limit distance.
- The integer parameters `u_i`, `v_i`, `p_j`, `q_j` in the `edgeList` and `queries` arrays are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than `n`.
- The integer parameters `u_i` and `v_i` in the `edgeList` arrays are not equal.
- The integer parameters `p_j` and `q_j` in the `queries` arrays are not equal.
- The integer parameters `dis_i` and `limit_j` in the `edgeList` and `queries` arrays are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The boolean array result `answer` in the method `CheckingExistenceOfEdgeLengthLimitedPaths` has a length equal to the length of the `queries` array.
- The boolean value in the `answer` array is true if there is a path for the corresponding query, and false otherwise.
