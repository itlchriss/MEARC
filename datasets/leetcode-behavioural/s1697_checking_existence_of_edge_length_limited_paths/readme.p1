Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` represents the number of nodes in the undirected graph.
- The integer array parameter `edgeList` contains edges between nodes, where each element is in the form [u, v, dis] representing an edge between nodes u and v with distance dis.
- The integer array parameter `queries` contains queries in the form [p, q, limit], where p and q are nodes and limit is the maximum distance allowed on the path between p and q.
- The boolean array result `answer` has a length equal to the length of queries.
- For each query in `queries`, the boolean value in `answer` is true if there exists a path between p and q where each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than the limit, and false otherwise.
