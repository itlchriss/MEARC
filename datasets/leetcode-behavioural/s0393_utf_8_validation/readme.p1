- The integer array parameter `data` represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
- For a 1-byte character in the UTF-8 encoding, the first bit is 0, followed by its Unicode code.
- For an n-bytes character in the UTF-8 encoding, the first n bits are all ones, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
- The input array `data` contains integers where only the least significant 8 bits of each integer are used to store the data.
- Each integer in the input array `data` represents only 1 byte of data.
- The output is a boolean value indicating whether the input array `data` is a valid UTF-8 encoding.
