- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50000.
- All values in the 2D integer array parameter `grid` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the number of points collected by the second robot.
- The first robot moves optimally to minimize the points collected by the second robot.
- The second robot moves optimally to maximize the points collected.
- The paths of the first and second robots may intersect.
- For all cells visited by the first robot, the value in the grid is set to 0.
