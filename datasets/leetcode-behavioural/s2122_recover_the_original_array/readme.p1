- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length of `2n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- The integer array result `arr` must have a length of `n`.
- The integers in the integer array parameter `nums` are split into two groups, where `n` integers belong to the `lower` array and the remaining `n` integers belong to the `higher` array.
- The integers in the `lower` array are obtained by subtracting a positive integer `k` from the corresponding integers in the `arr` array.
- The integers in the `higher` array are obtained by adding a positive integer `k` to the corresponding integers in the `arr` array.
- The integer array result `arr` is a valid original array that satisfies the conditions given the `lower` and `higher` arrays.
- If there are multiple valid original arrays that can be recovered, any of them can be returned as the output.
