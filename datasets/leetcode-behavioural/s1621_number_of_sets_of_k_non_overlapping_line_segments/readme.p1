Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n`.
- The integer result is the number of ways to draw exactly `k` non-overlapping line segments with integral coordinates, modulo 10^9 + 7.
