- The integer parameter `index` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than the integer parameter `n`.
- The integer parameter `maxSum` is greater than or equal to the integer parameter `n` and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the maximum value at the given index in the bounded array constructed according to the specified conditions.
- The sum of all elements in the constructed array does not exceed the `maxSum`.
- Each element in the constructed array is a positive integer.
