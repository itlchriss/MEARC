- The string parameters `a` and `b` must be of the same length.
- The boolean result is true if it is possible to form a palindrome string by splitting the strings `a` and `b` at the same index.
- The strings `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters.
- The length of the strings `a` and `b` is between 1 and 100000.
- The method must split both strings `a` and `b` at the same index to form two substrings each.
- The method must check if combining the prefix of `a` with the suffix of `b` or the prefix of `b` with the suffix of `a` results in a palindrome string.
- The method must return true if either combination forms a palindrome string, otherwise return false.
