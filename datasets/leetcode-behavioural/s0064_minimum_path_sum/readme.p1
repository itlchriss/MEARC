- The integer 2D array parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer 2D array parameter `grid` must have a length `m` and each sub-array within `grid` must have a length `n`.
- The integer result is the minimum sum of all numbers along the path from the top left to the bottom right of the `grid`.
- The path can only move either down or right at any point in time.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.
- The integer result is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer result is the sum of the numbers along the path that minimizes the sum.
