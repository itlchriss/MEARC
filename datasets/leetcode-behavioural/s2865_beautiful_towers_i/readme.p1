- The integer list parameter `maxHeights` must not be null.
- The length of the integer list parameter `maxHeights` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer list parameter `maxHeights` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The long result is the maximum possible sum of heights of a beautiful configuration of towers.
- The heights of the towers in the beautiful configuration must satisfy the conditions:
    - 1 <= heights[i] <= maxHeights[i]
    - The heights form a mountain array with a peak at index i where:
        - For all 0 < j <= i, heights[j - 1] <= heights[j]
        - For all i <= k < n - 1, heights[k + 1] <= heights[k]
