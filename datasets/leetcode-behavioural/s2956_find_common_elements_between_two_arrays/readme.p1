- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums2` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the integer array result is 2.
- All values in the integer array result are unique.
- The first value in the integer array result is the number of indices `i` such that `0 <= i < n` and `nums1[i]` occurs at least once in `nums2`.
- The second value in the integer array result is the number of indices `i` such that `0 <= i < m` and `nums2[i]` occurs at least once in `nums1`.
