- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `limit` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The integer array result is the lexicographically smallest array that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times.
- The lexicographically smallest array `a` is smaller than array `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, array `a` has an element that is less than the corresponding element in `b`.
