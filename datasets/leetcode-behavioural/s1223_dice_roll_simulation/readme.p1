Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 5000.
- The integer array parameter `rollMax` must have a length of 6.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `rollMax` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 15.
- The integer result is the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact `n` rolls, modulo 10^9 + 7.
