- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the integer array parameters `speed` and `efficiency` is equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- All values in the integer array parameters `speed` and `efficiency` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer result is the maximum performance of the team formed by selecting at most `k` engineers from the `n` engineers.
- The performance of a team is calculated as the sum of the engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among the selected engineers.
- The result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
