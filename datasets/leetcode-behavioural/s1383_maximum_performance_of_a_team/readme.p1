Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- The integer arrays `speed` and `efficiency` must have a length equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- Each element in the integer array `speed` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- Each element in the integer array `efficiency` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^8.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- The integer result is the maximum performance of the team formed by selecting at most `k` different engineers out of the `n` engineers.
