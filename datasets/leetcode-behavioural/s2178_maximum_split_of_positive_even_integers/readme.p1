- The long parameter `finalSum` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^10.
- The list of long integers result represents a valid split containing a maximum number of unique positive even integers that sum up to `finalSum`.
- If no valid split exists for `finalSum`, an empty list is returned.
- The order of integers in the result list does not matter.
- All integers in the result list are unique and positive even numbers.
