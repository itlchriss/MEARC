- The long parameter `finalSum` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^10.
- The list of long integers result represents a valid split containing a maximum number of unique positive even integers that sum up to `finalSum`.
- If no valid split exists for `finalSum`, the list of long integers result is empty.
- The order of integers in the list result does not matter.
