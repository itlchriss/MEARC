- The integer list parameter `robot` contains the positions of robots on the X-axis.
- The 2D integer array parameter `f` contains the positions and repair limits of factories on the X-axis.
- The integer result is the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots.
- The robots move in one direction, either negative or positive on the X-axis.
- Robots can be repaired at factories they reach that have not reached their repair limits.
- The initial direction of moving for some robots can be set at any moment.
- All robots move at the same speed and will not collide if moving in the same direction.
- If two robots move in opposite directions and meet, they do not collide.
- If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
- The distance a robot moves from one position to another is the absolute difference between the positions.
- The total distance traveled is the sum of the absolute differences between the initial and final positions of each robot.
- The output should be the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots.
