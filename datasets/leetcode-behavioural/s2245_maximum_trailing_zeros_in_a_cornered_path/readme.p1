- The integer array parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `grid` must have a size of `m x n`.
- Each cell in the integer array parameter `grid` contains a positive integer.
- The method should return the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path found in the `grid`.
- A cornered path is defined as a set of adjacent cells with at most one turn, moving either horizontally or vertically up to the turn without returning to a previously visited cell.
- The product of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.
- Horizontal movement means moving in either the left or right direction, while vertical movement means moving in either the up or down direction.
