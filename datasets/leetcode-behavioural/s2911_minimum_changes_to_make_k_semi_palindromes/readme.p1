- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to the length of string `s` divided by 2.
- The string parameter `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- The integer result is the minimum number of letter changes required to partition `s` into `k` substrings such that the sum of the number of letter changes required to turn each substring into a semi-palindrome is minimized.
