Method behavioural requirements:
- The 2D integer array parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer result is the number of closed islands in the 2D integer array parameter `grid`.
- An island is considered closed if it is completely surrounded by water (group of 1s) on all sides (left, top, right, bottom).
