- A closed island is an island totally surrounded by `1s` (all left, top, right, bottom).
- The length of the 2D array `grid` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of each row in the 2D array `grid` is equal to the length of the first row in the `grid`.
- The values in the 2D array `grid` are either 0 or 1.
