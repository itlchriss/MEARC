- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum possible sum of elements in a balanced subsequence of the integer array `nums`.
- A subsequence of `nums` is considered balanced if for every index `j` in the range `[1, k - 1]`, the condition `nums[ij] - nums[ij-1] >= ij - ij-1` holds.
- The length of the integer array `nums` is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array `nums` are greater than or equal to -1000000000 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
