- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length of `2 * n`.
- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 7.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer result is the maximum score achievable after performing `n` operations.
- In each operation, the score received is equal to the operation index multiplied by the greatest common divisor of the two chosen elements.
- After each operation, the chosen elements are removed from the `nums` array.
- The maximum score is the sum of scores obtained in each operation.
- The function `gcd(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
