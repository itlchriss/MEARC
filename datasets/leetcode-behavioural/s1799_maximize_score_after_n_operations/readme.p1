- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum score after performing `n` operations on the integer array parameter `nums`.
- In each operation, the score is calculated as `i * gcd(x, y)`, where `i` is the operation index and `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of the chosen elements `x` and `y`.
- After each operation, the chosen elements `x` and `y` are removed from the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The maximum score is achieved by choosing the optimal pair of elements `x` and `y` in each operation to maximize the total score.
