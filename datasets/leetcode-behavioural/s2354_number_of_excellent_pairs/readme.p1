- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 60.
- The long result is the number of distinct excellent pairs.
- A pair of numbers `(num1, num2)` is excellent if both `num1` and `num2` exist in the array `nums` and the sum of the number of set bits in `num1 OR num2` and `num1 AND num2` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Two pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are considered distinct if either `a != c` or `b != d`.
- A pair `(num1, num2)` where `num1 == num2` can also be excellent if there is at least one occurrence of `num1` in the array.
