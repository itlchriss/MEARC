- The integer array parameter `points` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `points` must contain integer coordinates of points on a 2D-plane.
- The integer result is the minimum cost to make all points connected.
- The minimum cost is calculated based on the Manhattan distance between points, which is defined as the absolute difference in x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in y-coordinates.
- All points are considered connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
