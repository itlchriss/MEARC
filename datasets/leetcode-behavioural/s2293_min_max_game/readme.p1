- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is a power of 2.
- The integer result is the last number that remains in the integer array `nums` after applying the algorithm.
- The integer result is within the range of 1 to 10^9.
- The length of the integer array `newNums` is equal to the length of `nums` divided by 2.
- The integer array `newNums` is created based on the algorithm described.
- The values in the integer array `newNums` are assigned according to the algorithm steps.
- The array `nums` is replaced with `newNums` after each iteration.
- The algorithm is repeated until the length of `nums` becomes 1.
- The last remaining number in `nums` after applying the algorithm is returned as the result.
