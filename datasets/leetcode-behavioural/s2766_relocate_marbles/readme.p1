- The integer array parameter `nums` represents the initial positions of marbles.
- The integer arrays `moveFrom` and `moveTo` are of equal length and represent the steps to move marbles from one position to another.
- At each step `i`, all marbles at position `moveFrom[i]` are moved to position `moveTo[i]`.
- The final output is a sorted list of occupied positions after all steps are completed.
- A position is considered occupied if there is at least one marble in that position.
- The output list contains unique positions where marbles are present.
- The output list is sorted in ascending order.
- The length of the output list is less than or equal to the length of the input array `nums`.
- The input arrays `nums`, `moveFrom`, and `moveTo` contain integers within the specified constraints.
- The method `relocateMarbles` returns a list of integers representing the final occupied positions after all steps are completed.
