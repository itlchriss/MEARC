- The integer array parameter `nums` represents the initial positions of marbles.
- The integer arrays `moveFrom` and `moveTo` represent the steps to move marbles from one position to another.
- The length of the `moveFrom` array is equal to the length of the `moveTo` array.
- At each step `i`, all marbles at position `moveFrom[i]` are moved to position `moveTo[i]`.
- The final output is a sorted list of occupied positions after all steps are completed.
- A position is considered occupied if there is at least one marble in that position.
- The output list contains positions that are occupied by marbles after all steps are completed.
