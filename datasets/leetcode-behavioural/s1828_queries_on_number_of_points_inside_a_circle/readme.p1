Method behavioural requirements:
- For each query in the integer array parameter `queries`, the integer result in the returned array is the number of points inside the circle described by the query.
- Points on the border of the circle are considered inside.
- The returned array has the same length as the integer array parameter `queries`.
- The order of the results in the returned array corresponds to the order of the queries in the integer array parameter `queries`.
