- The integer matrix parameter `obstacleGrid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `obstacleGrid` must have dimensions `m x n` where `m` and `n` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
- The integer matrix parameter `obstacleGrid` must only contain the values 0 or 1, where 0 represents a space and 1 represents an obstacle.
- The integer result is the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid, considering obstacles.
- The robot can only move down or right at any point in time.
- If there is an obstacle at a specific grid position, the robot cannot pass through that position.
- The robot must reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- The result is equal to 0 if there is an obstacle at the starting position or the ending position.
- The result is calculated by considering all possible paths that the robot can take while avoiding obstacles.
