Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum score obtained from all possible valid paths of the given sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The valid path is defined as choosing either `nums1` or `nums2` to traverse from index-0, traversing the current array from left to right, and changing the path to the other array if a repeated value is encountered.
- The score is the sum of unique values in a valid path.
- The result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
