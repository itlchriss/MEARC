- The integer parameter `source` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than 1000000.
- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than 1000000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `routes` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `routes` is unique.
- The sum of the lengths of all arrays in the integer array parameter `routes` is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the least number of buses needed to travel from the `source` bus stop to the `target` bus stop.
- If it is not possible to travel from the `source` bus stop to the `target` bus stop, the integer result is -1.
