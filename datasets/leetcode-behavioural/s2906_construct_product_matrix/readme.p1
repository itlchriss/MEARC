- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a 2D matrix of size `n * m`.
- The integer matrix result `p` must be a 2D matrix of size `n * m`.
- Each element `p[i][j]` in the integer matrix result `p` is calculated as the product of all elements in `grid` except for the element `grid[i][j]`.
- The product of elements in `grid` is taken modulo `12345`.
- The values in the integer matrix result `p` are calculated correctly based on the given condition.
- The integer matrix result `p` is returned as the product matrix of `grid`.
