- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 50.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is an array of length 2 where the elements are between 0 and `n - 1`.
- The length of the integer array parameter `price` is equal to `n`.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `price` is an even integer between 1 and 1000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `trips` is between 1 and 100.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `trips` is an array of length 2 where the elements are between 0 and `n - 1`.
- The integer result is the minimum total price sum to perform all the given trips.
