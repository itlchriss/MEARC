- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the list parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of 100000 and `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
- Each element in the list parameter `edges` is a list of two integers representing a directed edge from one node to another.
- The integer result is a list of integers representing the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable.
- The order of vertices in the result list does not matter.
