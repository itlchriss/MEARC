- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 100.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is the number of triplets (i, j, k) that meet the conditions specified.
- The triplets must satisfy the conditions: 0 <= i < j < k < nums.length and nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k] are pairwise distinct.
- The result must be returned as the number of triplets that meet the conditions.
