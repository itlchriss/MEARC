- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must have a size of n x n where n is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 250.
- All elements in the integer matrix parameter `matrix` are greater than or equal to -10^5 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- The long result is the maximum sum of the elements in the matrix after performing the operation of multiplying any two adjacent elements by -1 any number of times.
