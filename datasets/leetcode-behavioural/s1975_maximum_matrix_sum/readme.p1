- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must have a length of `n x n` where `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 250.
- All elements in the integer matrix parameter `matrix` are greater than or equal to -100000 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The long result is the maximum sum of the elements in the matrix after performing the mentioned operation.
- The operation involves choosing any two adjacent elements in the matrix and multiplying each of them by -1.
- Two elements are considered adjacent if they share a border.
- The goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements.
