- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `p` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000000000.
