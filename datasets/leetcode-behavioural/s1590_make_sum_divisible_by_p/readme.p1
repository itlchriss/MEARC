- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `p` must be greater than 0.
- If it is impossible to make the sum of the remaining elements divisible by `p`, the integer result is -1.
- If the sum of the elements in the integer array parameter `nums` is already divisible by `p`, the integer result is 0.
- If a subarray needs to be removed to make the sum of the remaining elements divisible by `p`, the integer result is the length of the smallest subarray that needs to be removed.
