- The string list parameter `tickets` contains a list of airline tickets where each ticket is represented as a list of two strings `[from, to]`.
- The string list result is the reconstructed itinerary in order.
- The reconstructed itinerary must start with `"JFK"`.
- If there are multiple valid itineraries, the one with the smallest lexical order when read as a single string should be returned.
- All tickets in the input list `tickets` must be used exactly once in the reconstructed itinerary.
- The input list `tickets` forms at least one valid itinerary.
