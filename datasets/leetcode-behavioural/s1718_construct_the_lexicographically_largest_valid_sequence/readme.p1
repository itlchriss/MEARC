- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20.
- The integer array result is a valid sequence that satisfies the given conditions.
- The integer array result is lexicographically largest among all valid sequences.
- The integer array result contains the integer 1 exactly once.
- Each integer between 2 and `n` occurs twice in the integer array result.
- For every integer `i` between 2 and `n`, the distance between the two occurrences of `i` in the integer array result is exactly `i`.
