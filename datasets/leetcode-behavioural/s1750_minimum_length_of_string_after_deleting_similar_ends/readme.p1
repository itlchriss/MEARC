- If the string parameter `s` consists of only one character, the integer result is 1.
- If the string parameter `s` consists of two different characters, the integer result is the length of the string `s`.
- If the string parameter `s` consists of three different characters, the integer result is 0.
- If the string parameter `s` consists of more than three characters and meets the conditions of the algorithm described in the business requirement, the integer result is the minimum length of the string after performing the described operation.
