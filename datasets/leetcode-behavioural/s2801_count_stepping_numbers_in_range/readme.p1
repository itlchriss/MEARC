- The integer parameter `low` and `high` must be represented as strings.
- The integer result is the count of stepping numbers in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.
- A stepping number is an integer where all adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly 1.
- The stepping number should not have a leading zero.
- The result should be modulo 10^9 + 7.
- The length of the integer parameters `low` and `high` is between 1 and 100.
- The integer parameters `low` and `high` consist of only digits and do not have any leading zeros.
