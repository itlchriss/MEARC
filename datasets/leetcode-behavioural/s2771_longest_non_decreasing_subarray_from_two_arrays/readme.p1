- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have the same length `n`.
- The integer array `nums3` must have the same length `n` as `nums1` and `nums2`.
- For each index `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, the value at index `i` in `nums3` must be either `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]`.
- The method must return an integer representing the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray in `nums3`.
- A subarray is defined as a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
- The method must choose the values in `nums3` optimally to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray.
- The method must handle cases where multiple non-decreasing subarrays of the same length exist and return the maximum achievable length.
- The constraints for the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be strictly adhered to.
- The method signature must match the given context.
