- The integer array parameter `rowSum` and `colSum` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `rowSum` and `colSum` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 500.
- All values in the integer array parameter `rowSum` and `colSum` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 100000000.
- The integer 2D array result represents a matrix of non-negative integers of size `rowSum.length x colSum.length`.
- The sum of each row in the result matrix is equal to the corresponding value in the `rowSum` array.
- The sum of each column in the result matrix is equal to the corresponding value in the `colSum` array.
- At least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.
