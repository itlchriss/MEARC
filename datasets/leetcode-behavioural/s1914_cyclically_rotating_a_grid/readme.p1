Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must have an even number of rows and columns.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer matrix result is the matrix after applying `k` cyclic rotations to it.
- Each layer in the matrix is cyclically rotated in the counter-clockwise direction.
- The elements in each layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the counter-clockwise direction during each rotation.
