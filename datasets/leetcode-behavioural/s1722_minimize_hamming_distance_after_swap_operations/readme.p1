- The integer arrays `source` and `target` must have the same length `n`.
- The integer arrays `source` and `target` must contain integers between 1 and 100000.
- The length of the integer array `allowedSwaps` must be between 0 and 100000.
- Each element in the integer array `allowedSwaps` must be a pair of indices `ai` and `bi` where `0 <= ai, bi <= n-1` and `ai` is not equal to `bi`.
- The integer result is the minimum Hamming distance between the arrays `source` and `target` after performing any amount of swap operations on array `source`.
