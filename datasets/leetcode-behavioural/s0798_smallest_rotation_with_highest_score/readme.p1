- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the rotation index `k` that corresponds to the highest score achievable by rotating the `nums` array.
- If there are multiple rotation indices that result in the highest score, the smallest index `k` should be returned.
