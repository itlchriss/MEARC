- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `arr` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 300.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000000.
- The integer result is the number of triplets (i, j, k) where a == b.
- The indices i, j, and k must satisfy the condition (0 <= i < j <= k < arr.length).
- The bitwise-xor operation is denoted by ^.
- The integer result is equal to 4 for the input arr = [2,3,1,6,7].
- The integer result is equal to 10 for the input arr = [1,1,1,1,1].
