- Each character in the input `words` and `result` must be decoded as a single digit from 0 to 9.
- Every pair of different characters in the input `words` and `result` must be mapped to different digits.
- The input `words` and `result` must be decoded as numbers without leading zeros.
- The sum of the decoded numbers in the input `words` must be equal to the decoded number in the `result`.
- The method `isSolvable` should return true if the equation is solvable based on the above rules, otherwise it should return false.
