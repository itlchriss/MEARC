- The integer array parameter `rec` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `rec` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `rec` is an array of length 2 representing the width and height of a rectangle.
- The integer result is the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles in the `rec` array.
- Two rectangles `i` and `j` (`i < j`) are considered interchangeable if they have the same width-to-height ratio.
- The interchangeable pairs of rectangles are determined by comparing the width-to-height ratio of each pair of rectangles in the `rec` array.
- The interchangeable pairs of rectangles are counted based on the equality of the width-to-height ratios.
- The result represents the total number of interchangeable pairs of rectangles in the `rec` array.
