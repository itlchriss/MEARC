- The string parameters `num1` and `num2` represent valid complex numbers.
- The integer part of the complex numbers represented by the string parameters `num1` and `num2` is in the range [-100, 100].
- The imaginary part of the complex numbers represented by the string parameters `num1` and `num2` is in the range [-100, 100].
- The imaginary unit i is defined as i^2 = -1.
- The string result represents the multiplication of the complex numbers represented by the string parameters `num1` and `num2`.
- The string result is in the form of "real+imaginaryi" where real and imaginary are integers.
- The string result is simplified to the form of "0+imaginaryi" if the real part is 0.
- The string result is simplified to the form of "real" if the imaginary part is 0.
