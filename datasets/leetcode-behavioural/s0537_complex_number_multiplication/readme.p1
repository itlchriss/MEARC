- The string parameter `num1` and `num2` represent valid complex numbers.
- The real part of the complex number is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
- The imaginary part of the complex number is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
- The imaginary unit i is represented as i^2 == -1.
- The string result represents the multiplication of the two complex numbers in the form of "real+imaginaryi".
- The result is simplified to the form of "0+imaginaryi" if the real part is 0.
- The result is simplified to the form of "real" if the imaginary part is 0.
