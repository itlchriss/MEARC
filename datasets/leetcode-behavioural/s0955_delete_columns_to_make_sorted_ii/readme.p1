- The integer array parameter `strs` must not be null.
- The length of each string in the array `strs` is equal to the length of the first string in the array `strs`.
- The integer result is the minimum possible value of the deletion indices `answer.length` to make the final array lexicographically ordered.
- The deletion indices `answer` must be such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in lexicographic order.
- If the initial array `strs` is not in lexicographic order, at least one deletion is required.
- If the initial array `strs` is already in lexicographic order, no deletions are needed.
