Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 400.
- The integer array parameter `edges` must not contain repeated edges.
- The integer array parameter `edges` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n * (n-1) / 2`.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` must have a length of 2.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` must have values greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer result is the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected trios.
