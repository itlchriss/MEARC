- The length of the integer array parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to n * (n-1) / 2.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The integer values in each element of the integer array parameter `edges` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to `n`.
- The integer values in each element of the integer array parameter `edges` are not equal to each other.
- There are no repeated edges in the integer array parameter `edges`.
- The integer result is the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected trios.
