- The integer parameter `grid` is a 2D array representing a gold mine with dimensions `m x n`.
- The integer result is the maximum amount of gold that can be collected following the given conditions.
- The result is obtained by traversing the grid starting from any cell with gold, moving one step at a time to the left, right, up, or down, collecting all the gold in each cell visited.
- The result is the sum of gold collected from all cells visited during the traversal.
- The result is greater than or equal to 0.
- The result is less than or equal to the sum of gold in all cells of the grid.
- The grid may contain cells with 0 gold, which cannot be visited.
- Each cell in the grid contains an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, where 0 indicates an empty cell.
- The dimensions of the grid `m x n` are such that `1 <= m, n <= 15`.
- There are at most 25 cells in the grid containing gold.
