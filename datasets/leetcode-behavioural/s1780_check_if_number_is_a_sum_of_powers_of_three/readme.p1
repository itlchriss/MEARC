Method behavioural requirements:
- The integer parameter `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^7.
- If it is possible to represent the integer parameter `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three, the boolean result is true.
- If it is not possible to represent the integer parameter `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three, the boolean result is false.
