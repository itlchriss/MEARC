- If the brick at the location specified by the integer array parameter `hits` is erased, all bricks that are no longer stable due to this erasure will fall.
- The integer array result contains the number of bricks that will fall after each erasure specified in the integer array parameter `hits` is applied.
- If an erasure refers to a location with no brick, no bricks will fall.
- The integer array parameter `grid` represents a binary grid where each 1 represents a brick and each 0 represents an empty space.
- A brick is considered stable if it is directly connected to the top of the grid or if at least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.
