- The integer parameter `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The length of the string parameter `word` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the length of the string parameter `word`.
- Each element in the integer array result is either 1 or 0.
- The integer array result `div` is such that `div[i] = 1` if the numeric value of `word[0,...,i]` is divisible by `m`, and `div[i] = 0` otherwise.
