- The string parameter `expression` only contains valid fractions in the format `±numerator/denominator`, where the numerator and denominator are in the range `[1, 10]`.
- The output string result is in the format `±numerator/denominator`, representing an irreducible fraction.
- If the final result is an integer, it should be converted to the format of a fraction with a denominator of `1`.
- The output string result does not contain the `'+'` sign if the fraction is positive.
- The output string result only contains `'0'` to `'9'`, `'/'`, `'+'`, and `'-'`.
- The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid and within the range of a 32-bit integer.
