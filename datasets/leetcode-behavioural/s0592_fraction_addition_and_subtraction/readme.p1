- The string parameter `expression` only contains characters `'0'` to `'9'`, `'/'`, `'+'`, and `'-'`.
- The string result is in the format `numerator/denominator` representing an irreducible fraction.
- If the numerator of the result is positive, the `'+'` sign is omitted.
- The numerator and denominator of each fraction in the input and output are in the range `[1, 10]`.
- If the denominator of a fraction is `1`, it represents an integer in fraction format.
- The number of fractions in the input is in the range `[1, 10]`.
- The numerator and denominator of the final result are valid and within the range of a 32-bit integer.
