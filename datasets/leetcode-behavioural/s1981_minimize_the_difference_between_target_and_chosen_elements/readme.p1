- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must have a length `m` and each row must have a length `n`.
- All values in the integer matrix parameter `mat` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 70.
- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 800.
- The integer result is the minimum absolute difference between the `target` and the sum of the chosen elements.
- The sum of the chosen elements is calculated by choosing one integer from each row in the matrix.
- The absolute difference between two numbers `a` and `b` is the absolute value of `a - b`.
