Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 800.
- The integer result is the minimum absolute difference between the target and the sum of the chosen elements.
- The sum of the chosen elements is calculated by choosing one integer from each row in the matrix.
- The absolute difference between two numbers `a` and `b` is the absolute value of `a - b`.
