- The integer array parameter `nums` contains objects colored red, white, or blue represented by integers 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
- After executing the method `sortColors`, the objects in the integer array parameter `nums` are sorted in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
- The method `sortColors` must solve the problem without using the library's sort function.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 300.
