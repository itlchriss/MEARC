- The integer parameter `ar` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than 24.
- The integer parameter `de` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 24.
- The integer result is the sum of the integer parameters `ar` and `de`, and if the result is greater than or equal to 24, it should be returned as the result modulo 24.
- The result represents the time when the train will arrive at the station in 24-hours format.
