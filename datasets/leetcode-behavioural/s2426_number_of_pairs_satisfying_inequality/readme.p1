- The integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- The length of the integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be equal.
- All values in the integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be greater than or equal to -10000 and less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer parameter `diff` must be greater than or equal to -10000 and less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is the number of pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy the conditions specified in the business requirement.
- The pairs `(i, j)` must meet the conditions: `0 <= i < j <= n - 1` and `nums1[i] - nums1[j] <= nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff`.
