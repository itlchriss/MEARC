- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum length of a subarray with a positive product.
- The length of the subarray is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of the array.
- The subarray with a positive product is a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.
- The subarray cannot include 0 since that would make the product 0 which is not positive.
