- The integer array parameter `logs` must not be null.
- Each element in the integer array parameter `logs` must be an array of length 2, where the first element represents the birth year and the second element represents the death year of a person.
- The birth year of each person must be less than the death year of that person.
- The birth year and death year of each person must be within the range of 1950 to 2050.
- The integer result is the earliest year with the maximum population.
- The maximum population is the number of people alive during a specific year, where a person is counted in the population if they were alive during that year (inclusive range of birth year to death year - 1).
- If there are multiple years with the maximum population, the earliest year among them should be returned.
