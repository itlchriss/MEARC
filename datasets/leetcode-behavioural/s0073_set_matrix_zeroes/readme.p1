- For the integer matrix parameter `matrix`, if an element is equal to 0, the entire row and column containing that element are set to 0.
- The method `setZeroes` must modify the input matrix `matrix` in place.
- The dimensions of the matrix `matrix` are such that `m == matrix.length` and `n == matrix[0].length`, where `1 <= m, n <= 200`.
- The values in the matrix `matrix` are within the range of `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.
- The method `setZeroes` should aim to achieve a constant space solution.
