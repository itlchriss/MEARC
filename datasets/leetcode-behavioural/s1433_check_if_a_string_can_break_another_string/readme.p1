- For all permutations of string `s1` and `s2` of size `n`, if there exists a permutation of `s1` that can break some permutation of `s2` or vice-versa, the boolean result is true.
- A string `x` can break string `y` if for all indices `i` between `0` and `n-1`, `x[i] >= y[i]` in alphabetical order.
