- The string parameters `s` and `t` represent non-negative rational numbers.
- The rational numbers can be represented using up to three parts: `<IntegerPart>`, `<NonRepeatingPart>`, and a `<RepeatingPart>`.
- The number can be represented in one of the following three ways:
    - `<IntegerPart>`
    - `<IntegerPart>.<NonRepeatingPart>`
    - `<IntegerPart>.<NonRepeatingPart>(<RepeatingPart>)`
- The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is denoted within a pair of round brackets.
- The method returns true if and only if the strings `s` and `t` represent the same number.
- The `<IntegerPart>` does not have leading zeros except for zero itself.
- The length of `<IntegerPart>` is between 1 and 4.
- The length of `<NonRepeatingPart>` is between 0 and 4.
- The length of `<RepeatingPart>` is between 1 and 4.
