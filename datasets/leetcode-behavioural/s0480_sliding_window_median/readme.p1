- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array `nums`.
- The length of the double array result is equal to the length of the integer array `nums` minus `k` plus 1.
- Each element in the double array result is the median of the sliding window of size `k` moving from the very left of the array to the very right.
- The median is calculated as the middle value in an ordered integer list, or the mean of the two middle values if the size of the list is even.
- Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted.
