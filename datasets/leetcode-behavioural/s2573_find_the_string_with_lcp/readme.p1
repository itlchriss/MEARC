- The string result `word` must be the alphabetically smallest string that corresponds to the given `lcp` matrix.
- If there is no string that corresponds to the given `lcp` matrix, the string result is an empty string.
- The `lcp` matrix must be a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is the length of the string.
- Each element in the `lcp` matrix must be between 0 and `n`.
- The string `word` must consist of lowercase English letters.
- The string `word` must have a length of `n`.
- The lexicographical order of the string `word` is determined by the position of the letters in the alphabet.
- The string `word` must satisfy the condition that the longest common prefix between substrings `word[i,n-1]` and `word[j,n-1]` is equal to the corresponding value in the `lcp` matrix at position `[i][j]`.
- The string `word` must be constructed based on the given `lcp` matrix.
