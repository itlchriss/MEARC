- The integer matrix parameter `lcp` must be a square matrix (n x n) where n is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer matrix parameter `lcp` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n.
- The string result is the alphabetically smallest string `word` that corresponds to the `lcp` matrix.
- If there is no such string that corresponds to the `lcp` matrix, the result is an empty string.
