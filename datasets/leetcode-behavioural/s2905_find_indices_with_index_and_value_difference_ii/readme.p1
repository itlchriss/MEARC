- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `indexDifference` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer parameter `valueDifference` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The length of the integer array result is 2 if there are two indices that satisfy the conditions, and the values are within the range of `[0, n - 1]`.
- If there are no two indices that satisfy the conditions, the integer array result is `[-1, -1]`.
