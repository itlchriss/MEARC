- The integer array parameter `nums` has an even length `n`.
- The integer parameter `limit` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves required to make the integer array `nums` complementary.
- In each move, any integer in the integer array `nums` can be replaced with another integer between 1 and `limit`, inclusive.
- The integer array `nums` is complementary if for all indices `i` (0-indexed), `nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i]` equals the same number.
- The output format should be a list with '-' as bullets.
