- The integer array parameter `nums` must have an even length.
- The integer parameter `limit` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of moves required to make the integer array `nums` complementary.
- After executing the method with the given method signature, the integer array `nums` is complementary, meaning for all indices `i`, `nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i]` equals the same number.
