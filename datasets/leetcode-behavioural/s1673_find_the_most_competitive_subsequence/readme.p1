- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the integer parameter `k`.
- The integer array result is a subsequence of the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The subsequence is the most competitive, meaning that in the first position where the subsequence and another subsequence differ, the number in the subsequence is less than the corresponding number in the other subsequence.
