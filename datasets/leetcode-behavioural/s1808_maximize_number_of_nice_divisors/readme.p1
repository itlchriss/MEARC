- The integer parameter `pf` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the number of nice divisors of `n` modulo 10^9 + 7.
- The number of prime factors of `n` is at most `pf`.
- The number of nice divisors of `n` is maximized.
- A divisor of `n` is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of `n`.
- The output format is a list with '-' as bullets.
