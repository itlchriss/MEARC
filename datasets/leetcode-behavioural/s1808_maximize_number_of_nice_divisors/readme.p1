- The integer parameter `pf` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the number of nice divisors of `n`.
- The number of prime factors of `n` is at most `pf`.
- The number of nice divisors of `n` is maximized.
- The result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
