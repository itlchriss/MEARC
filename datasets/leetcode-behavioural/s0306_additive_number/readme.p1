- The string parameter `num` must contain only digits.
- The boolean result is true if the string parameter `num` is an additive number, and false otherwise.
- An additive number is a string whose digits can form an additive sequence.
- A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers.
- Each subsequent number in the sequence, except for the first two numbers, must be the sum of the preceding two.
- Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros.
- The length of the string parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 35.
