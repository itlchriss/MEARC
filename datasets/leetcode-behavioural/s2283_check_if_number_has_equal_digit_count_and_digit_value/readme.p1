- For every index `i` in the range `0 <= i < n`, the digit `i` occurs `num[i]` times in the string `num`.
- If the condition holds true for every index in the string `num`, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
- If the condition does not hold true for any index in the string `num`, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
