- The integer matrix parameter `isWater` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `isWater` must have a size of `m x n` where `m` and `n` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer matrix `height` result must have a size of `m x n`.
- Each cell in the integer matrix `height` result must have a non-negative height.
- If a cell in the integer matrix `isWater` parameter is a water cell (value of 1), the corresponding cell in the integer matrix `height` result must have a height of 0.
- The absolute height difference between any two adjacent cells in the integer matrix `height` result must be at most 1.
- The maximum height in the integer matrix `height` result must be maximized.
- If there are multiple solutions, any valid solution is acceptable.
