- The integer matrix parameter `isWater` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `isWater` must have a size of `m x n` where `m` and `n` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
- The values in the integer matrix parameter `isWater` must be either 0 or 1.
- The integer matrix result `height` must have a size of `m x n`.
- The height of each cell in the `height` matrix must be non-negative.
- If a cell in the `isWater` matrix is a water cell (value 1), the height of the corresponding cell in the `height` matrix must be 0.
- The absolute height difference between any two adjacent cells in the `height` matrix must be at most 1.
- Cells are considered adjacent if they are directly north, east, south, or west of each other.
- The `height` matrix must be assigned heights in a way that maximizes the maximum height in the matrix.
- If there are multiple solutions that meet the above requirements, any valid solution is acceptable.
