- The integer array parameter `nums` must have an even length.
- In each round, the minimum element from the integer array `nums` is removed alternately by Alice and Bob.
- After removing the minimum element, Bob appends it to the resulting array `arr`, followed by Alice appending the removed element.
- The game continues until the integer array `nums` becomes empty.
- The resulting array `arr` contains the elements appended by Bob and Alice in the order they were removed from `nums`.
