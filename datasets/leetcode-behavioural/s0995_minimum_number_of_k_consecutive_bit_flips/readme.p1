- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array `nums`.
- The integer result is the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array.
- If it is not possible to have no 0 in the array after flipping, the integer result is -1.
