- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The integer array result has a length equal to `n`.
- Each element in the integer array result represents the minimum number of edge reversals required to reach any other node starting from the corresponding node.
- The output array should be returned as the result.
