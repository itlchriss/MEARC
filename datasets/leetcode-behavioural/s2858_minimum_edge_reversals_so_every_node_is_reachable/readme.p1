- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The first element of each inner array in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than `n`.
- The second element of each inner array in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than `n`.
- The first element of each inner array in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is not equal to the second element of the same inner array.
- The input is generated in such a way that if the edges were bi-directional, the graph would form a tree.
- The integer array result has a length equal to `n`.
- Each element in the integer array result represents the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from that node through a sequence of directed edges.
