- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- All `0`'s in both arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be replaced with strictly positive integers.
- The sum of elements in both arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be equal after replacing the `0`'s.
- The long result is the minimum equal sum that can be obtained after replacing the `0`'s in both arrays.
- If it is impossible to make the sum of both arrays equal, the result is `-1`.
