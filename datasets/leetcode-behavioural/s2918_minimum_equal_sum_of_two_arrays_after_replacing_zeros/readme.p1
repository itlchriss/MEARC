- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000000.
- The integer result is the minimum equal sum of elements that can be obtained after replacing all 0's in both arrays with strictly positive integers.
- If it is impossible to make the sum of both arrays equal, the integer result is equal to -1.
