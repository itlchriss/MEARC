- The integer list parameter `receiver` must not be null.
- The length of the integer list parameter `receiver` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer list parameter `receiver` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than the length of the list `receiver`.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000000000.
- The long result is the maximum value of the function `f(x)` for the chosen starting player `x` after `k` passes.
