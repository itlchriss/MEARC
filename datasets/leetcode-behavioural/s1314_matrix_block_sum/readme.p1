- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The integer matrix result `answer` has dimensions `m x n`, where `m` is the number of rows in the matrix `mat` and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix `mat`.
- Each element in the integer matrix result `answer` is the sum of elements in the submatrix of `mat` defined by the conditions:
    - `i - k <= r <= i + k`
    - `j - k <= c <= j + k`
    - `(r, c)` is a valid position in the matrix.
