- The integer parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^5.
- The integer result is the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of the integer array `nums` of which the sum is greater than or equal to the integer parameter `target`.
- If there is no such subarray, the integer result is equal to 0.
