- The integer array parameter `nums` must be non-empty and have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the maximum length of a non-decreasing array that can be made after applying operations.
- The array must be non-decreasing after applying operations, where each operation involves selecting a subarray and replacing it with the sum of its elements.
- The subarray selected for replacement must be contiguous.
- The result must be the maximum length achievable for a non-decreasing array after applying operations.
