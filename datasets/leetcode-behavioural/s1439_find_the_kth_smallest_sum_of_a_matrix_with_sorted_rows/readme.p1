- The integer matrix parameter `mat` has `m` rows and `n` columns.
- All rows in the integer matrix parameter `mat` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the minimum of 200 and n^m.
- The integer result is the kth smallest array sum among all possible arrays formed by choosing exactly one element from each row of the matrix `mat`.
