- The integer matrix parameter `mat` must have `m` rows and `n` columns where `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 40, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 40.
- All values in the integer matrix parameter `mat` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 5000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the minimum of 200 and `n` to the power of `m`.
- The integer result is the `k`-th smallest array sum among all possible arrays formed by choosing exactly one element from each row of the matrix `mat`.
