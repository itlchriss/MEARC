- The string parameter `dominoes` must not be null.
- The string result represents the final state of the dominoes after being pushed.
- The string result has the same length as the input string `dominoes`.
- The characters in the string result are either 'L', 'R', or '.'.
- If a domino is pushed to the left ('L'), it will push the adjacent domino on the left.
- If a domino is pushed to the right ('R'), it will push the adjacent domino on the right.
- If a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still.
- A falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.
