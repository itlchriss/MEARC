- The string parameter `s` must have an even length and consist of digits from 0 to 9.
- The integer parameter `a` must be between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
- The integer parameter `b` must be between 1 and the length of string parameter `s` - 1 (inclusive).
- The string result is the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by applying the operations of adding `a` to all odd indices and rotating `s` to the right by `b` positions on the string parameter `s`.
