- The integer parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 3000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 9.
- If there exists a set of positive integers with units digit `k` such that the sum of the integers is equal to `num`, the integer result is the minimum possible size of such a set.
- If no such set exists, the integer result is equal to -1.
