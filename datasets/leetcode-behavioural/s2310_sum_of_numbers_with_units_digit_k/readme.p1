- The integer parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 3000.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 9.
- If there exists a set of positive integers with units digit `k` that sum up to `num`, the integer result is the minimum possible size of such a set.
- If no such set exists, the integer result is -1.
- The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer.
- The sum of an empty set is considered 0.
