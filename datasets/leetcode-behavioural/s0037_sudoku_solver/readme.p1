- The 2D character array parameter `board` must have a length of 9.
- Each row in the 2D character array parameter `board` must have a length of 9.
- Each element in the 2D character array parameter `board` must be a digit from '1' to '9' or '.'.
- The method `solveSudoku` must fill in the empty cells of the `board` parameter to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
- The solution must satisfy the following rules:
    - Each digit from '1' to '9' must occur exactly once in each row.
    - Each digit from '1' to '9' must occur exactly once in each column.
    - Each digit from '1' to '9' must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
- The output of the method `solveSudoku` should be the solved Sudoku puzzle in the form of a 2D character array.
