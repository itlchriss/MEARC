- The length of the string array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of each string in the string array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.
- The length of the string parameter `target` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 100.
- All strings in the string array parameter `nums` and the string parameter `target` consist of digits and do not have leading zeros.
- The integer result is the number of pairs of indices (i, j) where i is not equal to j, and the concatenation of nums[i] + nums[j] is equal to the target string.
