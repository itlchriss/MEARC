Method behavioural specifications:
- The boolean result is true if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right in the integer matrix parameter `matrix` has the same elements.
- The boolean result is false if any diagonal from top-left to bottom-right in the integer matrix parameter `matrix` has different elements.
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` has dimensions `m x n` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` contains elements ranging from 0 to 99.
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` is stored in memory.
- The method can only load at most one row of the matrix into memory at once.
