- The long result is the total number of powerful integers in the range [start..finish].
- The long parameter `start` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^15.
- The long parameter `finish` is greater than or equal to `start` and is less than or equal to 10^15.
- The integer parameter `limit` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 9.
- The string parameter `s` has a length greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the floor(log10(finish)) + 1.
- The string parameter `s` only consists of numeric digits which are at most `limit`.
- The string parameter `s` does not have leading zeros.
