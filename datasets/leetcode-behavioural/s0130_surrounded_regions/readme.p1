- For the method `solve(char[][] board)`:
- All 'O's that are not on the border and are not connected to an 'O' on the border should be flipped to 'X'.
- Two cells are considered connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
- The input `board` is a 2D character array containing 'X' and 'O'.
- The output should be the modified `board` with surrounded regions flipped to 'X'.
- The dimensions of the `board` should be such that `1 <= m, n <= 200`.
- The input `board` should have dimensions `m x n`.
- The output `board` should have the same dimensions as the input `board`.
