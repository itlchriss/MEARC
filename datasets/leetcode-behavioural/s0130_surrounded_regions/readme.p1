- The method should not flip 'O's that are on the border of the board to 'X'.
- The method signature should be public void solve(char[][] board).
- The input board should be a matrix of characters containing 'X' and 'O'.
- The dimensions of the board should be m x n where 1 <= m, n <= 200.
- The characters in the board should be either 'X' or 'O'.
