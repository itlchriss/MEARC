- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must not be null.
- The integer matrix result `answer` has the same dimensions as the integer matrix parameter `matrix`.
- The integer matrix result `answer` contains the rank of each element in the integer matrix parameter `matrix`.
- The rank of an element in the integer matrix result `answer` is determined by comparing it to other elements in the same row and column.
- The rank of an element in the integer matrix result `answer` is an integer starting from 1.
- If two elements `p` and `q` are in the same row or column, the rank of `p` is less than the rank of `q` if `p < q`, equal if `p == q`, and greater if `p > q`.
- The rank of an element in the integer matrix result `answer` should be as small as possible.
- The integer values in the integer matrix result `answer` are unique under the given rules.
