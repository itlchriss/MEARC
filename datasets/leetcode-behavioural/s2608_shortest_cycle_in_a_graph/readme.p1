- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- Each element in the 2D integer array parameter `edges` has a length of 2.
- The values in each element of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than `n`.
- The values in each element of the 2D integer array parameter `edges` are not equal to each other.
- There are no repeated edges in the graph.
- The integer result is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph.
- If no cycle exists, the integer result is -1.
