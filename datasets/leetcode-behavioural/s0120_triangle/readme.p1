- The integer collection parameter `triangle` must not be null.
- The integer result is the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of the triangle.
- The minimum path sum is calculated by moving to an adjacent number of the row below at each step.
- The minimum path sum is the sum of the numbers from the top to the bottom that results in the smallest possible sum.
- The minimum path sum is calculated by choosing the smaller of the two adjacent numbers at each step.
- The minimum path sum is the sum of the numbers that form the path with the smallest sum from the top to the bottom of the triangle.
