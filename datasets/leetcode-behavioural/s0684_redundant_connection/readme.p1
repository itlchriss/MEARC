- The integer array parameter `edges` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `edges` represents a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added.
- The integer array parameter `edges` contains edges between nodes `a_i` and `b_i`.
- The integer array result is an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of `n` nodes.
- If there are multiple answers, the result is the answer that occurs last in the input.
