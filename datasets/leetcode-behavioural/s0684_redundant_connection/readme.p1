- The integer array parameter `edges` represents a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added.
- The integer array result is an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of `n` nodes.
- If there are multiple answers, the integer array result should contain the answer that occurs last in the input.
- The integer array parameter `edges` length is equal to `n`.
- The integer array parameter `edges` contains edges represented as pairs `[a, b]` where `a` and `b` are nodes in the graph.
- The integer array result is an edge represented as a pair `[a, b]` where `a` and `b` are nodes in the graph.
