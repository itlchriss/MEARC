- The integer parameters `m` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer matrix parameter `coordinates` must have a length less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer matrix parameter `coordinates` must contain pairs of distinct coordinates within the grid.
- The integer array result `arr` must have a size of 5.
- Each element in the integer array result `arr` represents the number of blocks that contain exactly `i` black cells.
- The grid is defined as a `m x n` grid where cells not present in `coordinates` are white.
- A block is defined as a `2 x 2` submatrix of the grid.
- The blocks are counted based on the number of black cells they contain.
- The output format of the method should be a list with '-' as bullets.
