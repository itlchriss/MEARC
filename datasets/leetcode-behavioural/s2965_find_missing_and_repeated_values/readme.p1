- The integer matrix parameter `grid` must be a 2D array of size `n * n` where `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 50.
- All values in the integer matrix parameter `grid` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to `n * n`.
- There is exactly one value `a` that appears twice in the matrix `grid`.
- There is exactly one value `b` that is missing from the matrix `grid`.
- The integer array result is of size 2.
- The first element in the integer array result is equal to the repeated value `a`.
- The second element in the integer array result is equal to the missing value `b`.
