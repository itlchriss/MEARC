- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must have values between 1 and 6, inclusive.
- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must have lengths between 1 and 100000.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of values in `nums1` equal to the sum of values in `nums2`.
- If it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal, the integer result is -1.
