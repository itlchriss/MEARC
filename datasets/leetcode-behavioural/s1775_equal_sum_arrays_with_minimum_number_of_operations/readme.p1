- The integer array parameter `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
- All values in the integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are between 1 and 6, inclusive.
- The integer result is the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of values in `nums1` equal to the sum of values in `nums2`.
- If it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal, the integer result is equal to -1.
