- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums2` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` are greater than or equal to -1000 and are less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums2` are greater than or equal to -1000 and are less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the outer list result is 2.
- The length of the inner list at index 0 of the result is equal to the number of distinct integers in `nums1` that are not present in `nums2`.
- The length of the inner list at index 1 of the result is equal to the number of distinct integers in `nums2` that are not present in `nums1`.
- The integers in the inner lists may be returned in any order.
