- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- The integer result is the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence of `nums` where the difference between adjacent elements is at most `k`.
- The length of the longest subsequence is returned as the result.
