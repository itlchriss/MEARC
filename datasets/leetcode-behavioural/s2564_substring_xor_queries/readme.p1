- The integer array parameter `queries` must not be null.
- The string parameter `s` must not be null and must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is a 2D array where each element is an array of two integers representing the left and right endpoints of the substring that satisfies the XOR condition for each query.
- If no substring satisfies the XOR condition for a query, the corresponding answer should be `[-1, -1]`.
- The decimal value of a substring is calculated by converting the binary substring to decimal.
- The XOR operation is performed between the decimal value of the substring and the given query values.
- The answer should include the minimum left index if there are multiple substrings that satisfy the XOR condition for a query.
