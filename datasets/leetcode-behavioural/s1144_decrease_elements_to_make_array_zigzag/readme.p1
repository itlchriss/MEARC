- If the integer array parameter `nums` is transformed into a zigzag array, the integer result is the minimum number of moves required to achieve this transformation.
- Each move consists of choosing any element in the integer array parameter `nums` and decreasing it by 1.
- A zigzag array is defined as an array where either every even-indexed element is greater than its adjacent elements or every odd-indexed element is greater than its adjacent elements.
- The integer array parameter `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
