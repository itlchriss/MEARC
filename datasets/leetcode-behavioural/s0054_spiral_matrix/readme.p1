- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must not be null.
- The integer matrix parameter `matrix` must have a length `m` and each row in the matrix must have a length `n`.
- The integer result is a list of all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
- The elements in the integer result list are ordered in a spiral manner starting from the top-left corner and moving clockwise.
- The length of the integer result list is equal to the total number of elements in the matrix.
- All elements in the integer result list are unique.
- The integer values in the matrix are within the range of -100 to 100.
- The integer values in the matrix are included in the integer result list in the order they appear in the spiral traversal.
