- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum absolute sum of any subarray of the integer array `nums`.
- The maximum absolute sum is calculated as the absolute sum of a subarray, which is the sum of all elements in the subarray, where the absolute sum of a subarray is abs(sum of elements).
- The absolute sum of a subarray is abs(x) where x is the sum of all elements in the subarray.
- If x is a negative integer, abs(x) = -x.
- If x is a non-negative integer, abs(x) = x.
- The length of the integer array `nums` is less than or equal to 10^5.
- The values in the integer array `nums` are within the range -10^4 to 10^4.
