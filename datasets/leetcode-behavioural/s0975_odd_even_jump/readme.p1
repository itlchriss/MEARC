- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The integer result is the number of good starting indices where starting from that index, the end of the array can be reached by jumping some number of times.
- A starting index is considered good if, starting from that index, the end of the array can be reached by following the odd and even jump rules.
- During odd-numbered jumps, the jump is made to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value.
- During even-numbered jumps, the jump is made to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value.
- If there are multiple indices `j` that satisfy the conditions for jumping, the smallest index `j` is chosen.
- It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.
