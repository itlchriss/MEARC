- The integer array parameter `nums` in the `Solution` constructor must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` in the `Solution` constructor may contain duplicates.
- The integer parameter `target` in the `pick` method must be an integer from the `nums` array.
- The `pick` method must return a random index `i` from `nums` where `nums[i] == target`.
- If there are multiple valid indices `i` for the given `target`, each index should have an equal probability of being returned.
- The `pick` method should handle at most 10^4 calls.
- The `pick` method should return null when called directly after the `Solution` constructor.
- The `pick` method should return the correct index based on the given `target` in the `nums` array.
