- The integer array parameter `nums` in the `Solution` constructor must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` in the `Solution` constructor may contain duplicates.
- The integer parameter `target` in the `pick` method must be an integer from the `nums` array.
- The `pick` method should return the index of a given `target` number in the `nums` array.
- If there are multiple valid indices for the `target`, each index should have an equal probability of being returned.
- The `pick` method should handle at most 10^4 calls.
- The `pick` method should return null if the `Solution` constructor is called.
- The `pick` method should return the index of the `target` number in the `nums` array.
