- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer result is the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence in the integer array parameter `nums`.
- The longest continuous increasing subsequence is a subarray of `nums` that is strictly increasing.
- The subsequence must be continuous, meaning all elements are adjacent in the original array.
- The length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence is greater than or equal to 1.
- The length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.
