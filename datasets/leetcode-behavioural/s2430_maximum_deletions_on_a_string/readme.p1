- The integer parameter `s` must not be null.
- The integer result is the maximum number of operations needed to delete all of the string `s`.
- The maximum number of operations is determined by deleting either the entire string or deleting the first `i` letters of `s` if they are equal to the following `i` letters in `s`, for any `i` in the range `1 <= i <= s.length / 2`.
