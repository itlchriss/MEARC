- The integer array parameter `arr` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `target` must be greater than 0.
- If there are two non-overlapping sub-arrays of `arr` each with a sum equal to `target`, the integer result is the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays.
- If there are no two non-overlapping sub-arrays of `arr` each with a sum equal to `target`, the integer result is -1.
