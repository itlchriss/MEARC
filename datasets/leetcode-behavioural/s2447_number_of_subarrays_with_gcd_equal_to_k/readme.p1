Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer array parameter `nums` length is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10^9.
- The integer result is the number of subarrays in `nums` where the greatest common divisor of the subarray's elements is `k`.
