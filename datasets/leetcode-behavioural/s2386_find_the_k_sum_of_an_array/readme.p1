- The integer array parameter `nums` must not be null.
- The integer parameter `k` is a positive integer.
- The long result is the k<sup>th</sup> largest subsequence sum that can be obtained from the array `nums`.
- The subsequence is an array that can be derived from `nums` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
- The empty subsequence is considered to have a sum of 0.
