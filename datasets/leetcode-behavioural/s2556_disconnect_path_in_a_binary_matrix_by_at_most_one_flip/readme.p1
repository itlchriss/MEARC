- The boolean result is equal to the true literal if it is possible to make the matrix disconnect by flipping at most one cell.
- The boolean result is equal to the false literal if it is not possible to make the matrix disconnect by flipping at most one cell.
- The integer matrix parameter `g` is a binary matrix with dimensions `m x n`.
- The integer matrix parameter `g` is a 0-indexed matrix.
- The integer matrix parameter `g` cannot have its cells `(0, 0)` and `(m - 1, n - 1)` flipped.
- The integer matrix parameter `g` contains only 0s and 1s.
- The dimensions of the integer matrix parameter `g` are such that `1 <= m, n <= 1000` and `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`.
