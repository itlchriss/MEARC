Method behavioural specifications:
- The integer array parameter `segments` must not be null.
- Each segment in the integer 2D array parameter `segments` must have a length of 3.
- The integer values in each segment must satisfy the constraints: <code>1 <= start<sub>i</sub> < end<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>5</sup></code> and <code>1 <= color<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>.
- Each `color<sub>i</sub>` value in the segments is distinct.
- The 2D array result `painting` must describe the finished painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of mixed colors.
- Each segment in the 2D array result `painting` must have a length of 3.
- The half-closed segments in the 2D array result `painting` must be represented as <code>[left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>, mix<sub>j</sub>]</code>.
- The sum of mixed colors in each segment of the 2D array result `painting` must be the sum of the elements in the set of mixed colors.
- The segments in the 2D array result `painting` can be returned in any order.
