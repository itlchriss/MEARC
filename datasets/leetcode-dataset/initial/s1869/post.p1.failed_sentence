The input for the method should be a binary string `s` that the function takes.The expected outcome for the method `checkZeroOnes(String s)` is a boolean value (`true` or `false`), indicating whether the parameter string `s` contains a sequence of ones followed by a sequence of zeros.The longest contiguous segment of `1`s in the input string `s` should be determined by the function.The longest contiguous segment of `0`s in the input string `s` should be determined by the function.The lengths of the longest contiguous segments of `1`s and `0`s should be compared by the function.If the length of the longest continuous sequence of `1`s in the string parameter `s` is greater than the length of the longest continuous sequence of `0`s in `s`, the returned boolean value should be `true`.If the longest contiguous segment of `1`s in the string `s` is not longer than the longest contiguous segment of `0`s in the string `s`, the returned boolean value should be `false`.
