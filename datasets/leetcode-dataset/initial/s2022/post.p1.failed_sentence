To determine if it is feasible to accommodate 2 elements within a 1x1 2D array, the condition of the array's dimensions being m by n should be checked.If the number of elements in the original array is not sufficient to fill an m x n 2D array, the resulting 2D array should be empty.According to a specific procedure, an m x n 2D array should be constructed by the system, based on the original array parameter, where m and n represent the desired dimensions.If the procedure cannot construct the 2D array with dimensions m x n using the original array, the system should return an empty 2D array.The original array is not null. 
The array of parameters is sorted in ascending order.The system being described in these sentences, which is the system being described, is referred to by the pronouns "str_it" and "the system".
