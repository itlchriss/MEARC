In the binary grid `matrix`, the algorithm should choose an index `(i, j)` randomly. This index should satisfy the condition `matrix[i][j] == 0`.The selected index `(i, j)` from `0` to `1` should have its value flipped by the algorithm.All indices `(i ,  j)` where `matrix[i][j] == 0` should be returned with an equal probability, for the method `public Solution(int nRows, int nCols)`, where `nRows` represents the number of rows and `nCols` represents the number of columns.The `m x n` binary grid `matrix` should be able to be instantiated with all values initially set to `0` when using the public Solution(int nRows, int nCols) method.The ability to reset all values in the matrix to `0` should be present in the algorithm.After resetting the matrix, the algorithm should be capable of randomly selecting an index `(i, j)` from the binary grid `matrix` where the value at `matrix[i][j]` is equal to 0.After the matrix is reset, the algorithm should have the capability to change the value at the specified index `(i, j)` from `0` to `1`.After resetting the matrix, all indices `(i, j)` where the element at `matrix[i][j]` is equal to 0 should have an equal probability of being returned.
