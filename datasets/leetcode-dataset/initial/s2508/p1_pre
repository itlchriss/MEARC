The method takes two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the graph, and a list of lists `edges` representing the edges between nodes.
The `edges` list contains lists of two integers, representing the nodes connected by an edge.
The graph is represented by an adjacency list, where each index in the list represents a node, and the value at that index is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to it.
