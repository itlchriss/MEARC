Preconditions:
- The method takes two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the graph, and a list of lists `edges` representing the edges between nodes.
- The `edges` list contains lists of two integers, representing the nodes connected by an edge.
- The graph is represented by an adjacency list, where each index in the list represents a node, and the value at that index is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to it.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a boolean value: `true` if it is possible to make the degree of each node in the graph even, and `false` otherwise.
