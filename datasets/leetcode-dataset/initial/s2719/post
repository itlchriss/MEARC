Return _the number of good integers_. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>. **Explanation:** There are 11 integers whose sum of digits lies between 1 and 8 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11, and 12. Thus, we return 11. **Explanation:** The 5 integers whose sum of digits lies between 1 and 5 are 1,2,3,4, and 5. Thus, we return 5.
