Note that in case a character of the string is **not present** in `keys`, the encryption process cannot be carried out, and an empty string `""` is returned. initial prepare.sh run.sh `String encrypt(String word1)` Encrypts `word1` with the encryption process described above and returns the encrypted string. encrypter.encrypt("abcd"); // return "eizfeiam". encrypter.decrypt("eizfeiam"); // return 2.
initial prepare.sh run.sh `int decrypt(String word2)` Returns the number of possible strings `word2` could decrypt to that also appear in `dictionary`.
