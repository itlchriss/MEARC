The target with the maximum count should be returned by the function when the key is passed as a parameter in the array nums.The target with the maximum count is referred to as str_it.If there are no other integers following an occurrence of key in the parameter array nums, the result of the method mostFrequent should not be null.If the maximum number of occurrences following an occurrence of the key in the sorted ascending order of the parameter array is equal to the target, the result should not be null.The test cases will be generated in a way that the array of parameters, nums, will have a unique target with the maximum count.The key is used to find the most frequent element in the nums array.
