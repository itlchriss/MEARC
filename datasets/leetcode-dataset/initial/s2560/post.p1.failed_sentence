By considering all the possible ways to steal at least k houses in the given int array nums, we can determine the minimum capability of the robber. In this specific case, there are 7 ways to rob the houses. Among these ways, the one that results in the minimum capability is when the robber targets the houses at index 0 and 4 in the nums array. To find the minimum capability, we compare the values of nums[0] and nums[4] in the nums array and return the maximum value, which is 2.
