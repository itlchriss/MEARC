You are given an integer array `nums` representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> house from the left has `nums[i]` dollars. You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least `k` houses.
