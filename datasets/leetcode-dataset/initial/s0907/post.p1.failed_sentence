To solve the problem in the Java method public int sumSubarrayMins(int[] arr), we need to find the sum of the minimum value of each subarray in the given array of integers arr. The subarrays are contiguous, meaning they consist of consecutive elements in arr. The result should be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
