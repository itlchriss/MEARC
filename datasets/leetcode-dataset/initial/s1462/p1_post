The method should return a boolean array `answer` with dimensions `m x 1`, where `m` is the number of queries.
Each element in the `answer` array, `answer[j]`, should be the answer to the `jth` query.
If `course1` is a prerequisite for `course2`, then `answer[j]` should be `true`.
If `course1` is not a prerequisite for `course2`, then `answer[j]` should be `false`.
