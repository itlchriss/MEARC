The method should return an integer value representing the length of the shortest subarray.
The returned length should be at least The returned length should be the length of the shortest subarray in the input array "nums".
The shortest subarray should consist of consecutive elements from the input array "nums".
The shortest subarray should have the maximum degree (frequency) among all subarrays of the same length.
If there are multiple subarrays with the same maximum degree, the method should return the length of the first encountered subarray.
