The bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the array `nums3` should be calculated by the function.The calculated bitwise XOR value should be returned by the function.In the case where the array `nums3` is empty, the expected outcome is for the function to handle it and return 0.The bitwise XOR value should be returned by the function when handling an array `nums3` with only one number.The array `nums3` with multiple numbers should be handled by the function in order to correctly calculate the bitwise XOR value.The bitwise XOR value should be calculated correctly by the function when handling negative numbers in the array `nums3` and when the array is sorted in ascending order.The bitwise XOR value should be calculated correctly by the function when handling zero as a number in the array `nums3`, using the parameters `nums1` and `nums2`.
