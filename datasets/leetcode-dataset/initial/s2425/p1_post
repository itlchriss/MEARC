The method returns an integer value, which is the bitwise XOR of all integers in the resulting array `nums3`.
The resulting array `nums3` is formed by combining the elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
The bitwise XOR of all integers in `nums3` is equal to - If the resulting array `nums3` is empty, the method returns 0.
