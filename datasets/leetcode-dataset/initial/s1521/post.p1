To find the closest value to the target in the given Java method (public int closestToTarget(int[] arr, int target)), you need to calculate the absolute difference between the output of the function when applied to the array within the specified range (l to r) and the target value. Make sure the output of the function is not equal to the target value. Return the minimum possible value of this absolute difference.
