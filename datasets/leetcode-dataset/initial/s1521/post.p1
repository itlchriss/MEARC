Preconditions:
The input array `arr` is not null.
The input array `arr` is not empty.
The input target value `target` is not null.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the minimum possible value of `|func(arr, l, r) - target|`.
The returned value is the absolute difference between the result of `func(arr, l, r)` and the target value `target`.
The returned value is the minimum possible difference between the result of `func(arr, l, r)` and the target value `target`.
The returned value is the minimum possible absolute difference between the result of `func(arr, l, r)` and the target value `target`.
The returned value is the minimum possible value that can be obtained by subtracting the target value `target` from the result of `func(arr, l, r)` or vice versa.
The returned value is an integer value.
The returned value is the closest possible value to the target value `target` based on the calculation of `func(arr, l, r)`.
The returned value is the closest possible value to the target value `target` among all possible values obtained by calculating `func(arr, l, r)` for different values of `l` and `r`.
The returned value is the minimum possible absolute difference between the target value `target` and any possible value obtained by calculating `func(arr, l, r)` for different values of `l` and `r`.
The returned value is the minimum possible difference between the target value `target` and any possible value obtained by calculating `func(arr, l, r)` for different values of `l` and `r`.
The returned value is the minimum possible value that can be obtained by subtracting any possible value obtained by calculating `func(arr, l, r)` for different values of `l` and `r` from the target value `target` or vice versa.
