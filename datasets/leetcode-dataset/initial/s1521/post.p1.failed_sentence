The capability to calculate the value of `func(arr, l, r)` should be present in the system, where the parameter array `arr` is used and the values of `l` and `r` are provided.The ability to compute the absolute difference between `func(arr ,  l ,  r)` and `target` should be possessed by the system.The ability to yield the smallest attainable value of the absolute difference should be possessed by the system.The minimum possible value can be found by considering all possible combinations of `arr`, `l`, and `r`, ensuring that the system takes into account the parameter array being sorted in ascending order and the result not being null.The capability to manage various types of input for `arr`, `target`, `l`, and `r` should be possessed by the system.The scenario in which `arr` is an empty array should be handled by the system.The condition of `l` and `r` being out of bounds for the provided `arr` must be handled by the system.The condition of `target` being outside the range of possible values for `func(arr, l, r)` must be handled by the system.In the event that the minimum possible value cannot be calculated, the system should provide an error message or notification.
