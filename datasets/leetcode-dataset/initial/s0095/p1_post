The method should return a list of TreeNode objects representing all the structurally unique BSTs.
Each TreeNode object in the list should have exactly `n` nodes.
Each node in the BST should have a unique value from `1` to `n`.
The BSTs in the list should be structurally unique, meaning they have different arrangements of nodes.
The order of the BSTs in the list does not matter.
