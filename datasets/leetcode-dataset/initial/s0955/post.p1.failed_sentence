The minimum number of deletions required to arrange the elements of the array in lexicographic order should be determined by the algorithm.To find the minimum value of `answer.length`, the algorithm should consider all possible sets of deletion indices. This consideration should strictly adhere to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null" and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order".The lexicographic order of the elements in the array should be determined by comparing them, adhering to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."The deletion indices chosen should be used by the algorithm to delete elements from the array.The length of `answer` that the algorithm should return as its minimum possible value is the one that strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order.", and is explicitly related to the parameters of the method public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs).
