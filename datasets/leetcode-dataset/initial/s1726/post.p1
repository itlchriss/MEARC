Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` contains distinct positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` that satisfy the condition `a * b = c * d`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are elements of `nums` and `a != b != c != d`.
