Preconditions:
The input parameter 'n' represents the total number of rows in the cinema.
The input parameter 'reservedSeats' is a 2D array representing the reserved seats in the cinema.
The 'reservedSeats' array contains valid seat numbers within the range of the total number of rows and columns in the cinema.
The 'reservedSeats' array does not contain duplicate seat numbers.
The 'reservedSeats' array does not contain seat numbers that are outside the range of the total number of rows and columns in the cinema.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the maximum number of four-person groups that can be assigned on the cinema seats.
The returned value is greater than or equal to zero.
The returned value is less than or equal to the total number of rows in the cinema multiplied by 2 (since each row can accommodate at most two four-person groups).
The method does not modify the input parameters 'n' and 'reservedSeats'.
The method handles the exceptional case where an aisle splits a four-person group in the middle, allowing two people on each side.
