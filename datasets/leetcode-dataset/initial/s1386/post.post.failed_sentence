_Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats._ A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats **in one single row**. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.
