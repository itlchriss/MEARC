The method returns an integer value representing the maximum number of four-person groups that can be assigned on the cinema seats.
The returned value is greater than or equal to zero.
The returned value is less than or equal to the total number of rows in the cinema multiplied by 2 (since each row can accommodate at most two four-person groups).
The method does not modify the input parameters 'n' and 'reservedSeats'.
The method handles the exceptional case where an aisle splits a four-person group in the middle, allowing two people on each side.
