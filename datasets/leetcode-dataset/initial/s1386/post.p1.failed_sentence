The capability to ascertain the maximum count of four-person groups that can be allocated on the cinema seats is required, solely when the groups occupy four adjacent seats in a single row.The seating arrangement should ensure that each group of four people occupies four consecutive seats in a single row, without considering seats across an aisle as consecutive.In the case where an aisle splits a group of four people, the group should be split in the middle with two people on each side. This situation is considered exceptional.
