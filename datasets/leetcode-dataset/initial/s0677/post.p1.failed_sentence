The Java method `mapSum . sum(str_ap)` will return 3 only when it represents the sum of the values for keys that start with the prefix "ap" (where the value of the key "apple" is 3). Similarly, `mapSum . sum(str_ap)` will return 5 only when it represents the sum of the values for keys that start with the prefix "ap" (where the values of the keys "apple" and "app" are 3 and 2 respectively), just like the previous example.
