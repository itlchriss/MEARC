**Explanation:** "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
Return _any permutation of_ `s` _that satisfies this property_.
