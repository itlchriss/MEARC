The method should return an integer representing the least time required to reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1).
The returned time should be the minimum possible time considering the elevation of each square.
If it is not possible to reach the bottom right square, the method should return -The method should not modify the original grid.
The method should use the bfs(int[][] grid, int limit) method to perform the breadth-first search algorithm with the given limit.
