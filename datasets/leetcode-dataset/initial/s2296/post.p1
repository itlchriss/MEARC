The `deleteText` function in the TextEditor class is used to delete a specified number of characters to the left of the cursor. It takes an integer parameter `k` which represents the number of characters to be deleted. The function returns an integer value which represents the actual number of characters that were deleted.

To delete the characters, the function first moves the cursor to the left `k` times using the `cursorLeft` function. This function also takes an integer parameter `k` and returns a string containing the last `min(10, len)` characters to the left of the cursor, where `len` is the number of characters to the left of the cursor.

After moving the cursor, the function deletes the characters by calling the `deleteText` function. The function then returns the number of characters that were actually deleted.

Similarly, if the cursor needs to be moved to the right, the `cursorRight` function is used. This function also takes an integer parameter `k` and returns a string containing the last `min(10, len)` characters to the left of the cursor.

In summary, the `deleteText` function in the TextEditor class deletes a specified number of characters to the left of the cursor and returns the actual number of characters that were deleted. The cursor is moved using the `cursorLeft` or `cursorRight` functions, and the resulting string is determined by the `min(10, len)` characters to the left of the cursor.
