The method `fizzBuzz` should take an integer `n` as input.
The method should return a list of strings `answer`.
The list `answer` should be 1-indexed, meaning the first element of the list should be at index The length of the list `answer` should be equal to the input integer `n`.
Each element in the list `answer` should be a string.
The elements in the list `answer` should follow the FizzBuzz pattern.
If a number is divisible by 3, the corresponding element in the list `answer` should be "Fizz".
If a number is divisible by 5, the corresponding element in the list `answer` should be "Buzz".
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the corresponding element in the list `answer` should be "FizzBuzz".
If a number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the corresponding element in the list `answer` should be the string representation of the number.
The order of elements in the list `answer` should be the same as the order of numbers from 1 to `n`.
