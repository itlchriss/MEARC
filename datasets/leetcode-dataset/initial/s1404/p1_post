The method should return an integer value representing the number of steps required to reduce the binary representation to If the input string `s` is already equal to "1", the method should return The method should handle leading zeros in the binary representation correctly.
The method should handle negative binary representations correctly.
The method should handle large binary representations within the range of integer values correctly.
