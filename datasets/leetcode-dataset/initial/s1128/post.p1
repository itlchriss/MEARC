The count of pairs (i, j) within the range of the length of the dominoes array, where i is less than j, should be determined by the system.To determine if they are equivalent, the values of dominoes[i] and dominoes[j] should be compared.The counter should be incremented by the system each time a pair (i, j) is found where the element at index i in the dominoes array is equivalent to the element at index j in the dominoes array, and the dominoes array is the parameter array sorted in ascending order.The count of pairs should be returned as the final result by the system.
