**Explanation:** No sequence of traversals can take us from index 0 to index 2 in this example. So, we return false. **Explanation:** There are 6 possible pairs of indices to traverse between: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). A valid sequence of traversals exists for each pair, so we return true.
Return `true` _if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices,_ _or_ `false` _otherwise._
