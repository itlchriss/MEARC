Preconditions:
The method should take two arrays as input: `values` and `labels`.
The `values` array should contain integer values.
The `labels` array should contain integer labels corresponding to the values.
The `numWanted` parameter should be a positive integer representing the maximum number of values to be selected from the subset.
The `useLimit` parameter should be a positive integer representing the maximum number of times a label can be used in the subset.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the maximum score of the subset.
The subset should contain at most `numWanted` values.
Each label in the subset should be used at most `useLimit` times.
The maximum score should be calculated based on the sum of the values in the subset.
The subset should be selected in a way that maximizes the score.
