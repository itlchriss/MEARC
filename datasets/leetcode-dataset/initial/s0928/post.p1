Preconditions:
- The `graph` parameter must be a 2D array of integers representing the adjacency matrix of a graph.
- The `initial` parameter must be an array of integers representing the initial infected nodes in the graph.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer representing the node that, if removed, would minimize `M(initial)`.
- If there are multiple nodes that could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, the method should return the node with the smallest index among them.
