The `nums` parameter, representing the input permutation, should strictly adhere to a zero-based indexing system.The output array `ans` should have the same length as the input permutation `nums`, and its indices should start from `0` and go up to `nums.length - 1`. Each index `i` in this range should have the value at index `i` in `ans` equal to the value at index `nums[i]` in `nums`. The result of this process is the output array `ans`.
