Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` is a zero-based permutation, meaning that it contains distinct integers from 0 to `nums.length - 1` in any order.

Postconditions:
- The output array `ans` is not null.
- The output array `ans` has the same length as the input array `nums`.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `nums.length - 1`, `ans[i]` is equal to `nums[nums[i]]`.
