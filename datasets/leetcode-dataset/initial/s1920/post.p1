Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is a zero-based permutation.
- The length of the input array `nums` is the same as the length of the output array `ans`.

Postconditions:
- The output array `ans` is of the same length as the input array `nums`.
- For each index `i` in the range `0 <= i < nums.length`, the value at index `i` in the output array `ans` is equal to the value at index `nums[i]` in the input array `nums`.
