The method should return an integer value representing the minimum possible score to make `t` a subsequence of `s`.
The returned score should be non-negative.
If `t` is already a subsequence of `s`, the returned score should be If it is not possible to make `t` a subsequence of `s`, the returned score should be -1 or any other designated value to indicate impossibility.
