The result of the method minimalKSum, when given an array of integers nums and an integer k, is equal to the sum of the k integers appended to nums. For example, if the sum of the two integers appended is equal to 2 + 3 = 5, then the result will be 5. Similarly, if the sum of all six integers appended is equal to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 25, then the result will be 25 as well.
