Preconditions:
The input integer `k` must be a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the number of non-negative integers `x` that satisfy the property `f(x) = k`.
The returned value should be non-negative.
If there are no non-negative integers `x` that satisfy the property `f(x) = k`, the method should return 0.
