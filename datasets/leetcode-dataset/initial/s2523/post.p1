The array `ans` should be returned by the function, and it should contain two positive integers.In the case where there exist multiple pairs that satisfy the conditions, the pair with the minimum value for `left` should be returned.If there are no pairs of prime numbers between the values of the left and right parameters that satisfy the given conditions, the function should return an array containing the values [-1, -1].
