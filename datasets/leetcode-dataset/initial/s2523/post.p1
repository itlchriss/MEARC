Preconditions:
- The method takes two integer parameters, `left` and `right`.
- `left` and `right` are positive integers.
- `left` is smaller than or equal to `right`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer array `ans` of size - `ans[0]` is the smallest prime number between `left` and `right` (inclusive) that satisfies the given conditions.
- `ans[1]` is the corresponding number that forms a pair with `ans[0]`.
- If there are multiple pairs satisfying the conditions, the pair with the minimum `ans[0]` value is returned.
- If there are no numbers that satisfy the conditions, the method returns `[-1, -1]`.
