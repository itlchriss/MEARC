Preconditions:
- The method takes two integer parameters, `memory1` and `memory2`, representing the available bits of memory in the first and second sticks respectively.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an array containing three elements: `crashTime`, `memory1_crash`, and `memory2_crash`.
- `crashTime` is an integer representing the time (in seconds) when the program crashed.
- `memory1_crash` is an integer representing the available bits of memory in the first stick at the time of the crash.
- `memory2_crash` is an integer representing the available bits of memory in the second stick at the time of the crash.
