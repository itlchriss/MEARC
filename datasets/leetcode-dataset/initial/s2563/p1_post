The method should return the number of fair pairs as a long integer.
A fair pair is defined as a pair of indices `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n` and `lower <= nums[i] - nums[j] <= upper`.
The method should handle both positive and negative values in the input array `nums`.
The method should handle duplicate values in the input array `nums`.
The method should handle the case where there are no fair pairs and return 0.
