The method should return a 2-dimensional array `diff`.
The dimensions of `diff` should be the same as the input grid.
Each element in `diff` should be the difference between the corresponding elements in the input grid.
The elements in `diff` should be integers.
The elements in `diff` should be calculated by subtracting the corresponding elements in the input grid.
The elements in `diff` should be calculated by subtracting the ones from the zeros in the input grid.
