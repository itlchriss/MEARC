If the linked list passed as the "head" parameter in the "copyRandomList" method is empty (i.e., has a null pointer), then the method should return the value specified by the "null_value" parameter. Otherwise, if the linked list is not empty, the method should create a copy of the linked list and return the head of the copied linked list.
