The method should return an integer value representing the length of the longest ZigZag path in the tree.
The returned value should be greater than or equal to The method should handle the case where the input TreeNode is null and return 0 in such cases.
The method should traverse the tree and identify the longest ZigZag path.
The ZigZag path should alternate between left and right child nodes of each parent node.
The length of the ZigZag path should be calculated based on the number of edges traversed, not the number of nodes.
The method should consider both left and right child nodes of each parent node while determining the ZigZag path.
The method should handle cases where a parent node has only one child (either left or right) and still consider it as part of the ZigZag path.
The method should handle cases where a parent node has both left and right child nodes, but one of them is null, and still consider it as part of the ZigZag path.
The method should handle cases where the ZigZag path starts from the root node and consider it as part of the longest ZigZag path.
The method should handle cases where the ZigZag path starts from a child node and consider it as part of the longest ZigZag path.
The method should handle cases where the ZigZag path ends at a leaf node and consider it as part of the longest ZigZag path.
The method should handle cases where the ZigZag path ends at a node with only one child and consider it as part of the longest ZigZag path.
The method should handle cases where the ZigZag path ends at a node with both left and right child nodes, but one of them is null, and still consider it as part of the longest ZigZag path.
