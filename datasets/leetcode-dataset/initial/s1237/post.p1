A Java method, `findSolution`, takes a `CustomFunction` object and an integer `z` as parameters. The `CustomFunction` object represents a callable function with a hidden formula. By calling this function with integer pairs `x` and `y`, we can reverse engineer the formula to find all positive integer pairs that satisfy the equation `f(x, y) == z`. The method returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a pair of integers `x` and `y`. The order of the pairs in the returned list can be arbitrary.
