To guarantee reliability, the function `f(x, y)` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` as inputs and produces a positive integer output.In order to understand the hidden formula used in `f(x, y)` and reverse engineer it, it is necessary to comprehend it.The function `reverseEngineerFormula` accepts a function `f(x, y)` that can be called and a value `z` as inputs. It generates pairs of positive integers `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `f(x, y) = z`.The positive integer pairs `x` and `y` can be arranged in any order, as long as they are returned, when the method is called with the parameters `customfunction` and `z`.
