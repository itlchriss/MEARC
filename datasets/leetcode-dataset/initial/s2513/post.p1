Preconditions:
- The method should take four integer parameters: `divisor1`, `divisor2`, `uniqueCnt1`, and `uniqueCnt2`.
- The values of `divisor1` and `divisor2` should be positive integers.
- The values of `uniqueCnt1` and `uniqueCnt2` should be non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer value.
- The returned value should be the minimum possible maximum integer that can be present in either array.

Additional requirements:
- The maximum value in the first array should be less than or equal to `divisor1`.
- The maximum value in the second array should be less than or equal to `divisor2`.
- The number of unique elements in the first array should be equal to `uniqueCnt1`.
- The number of unique elements in the second array should be equal to `uniqueCnt2`.
