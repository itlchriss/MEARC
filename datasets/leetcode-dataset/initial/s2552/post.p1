 `nums[i] < nums[k]`, `nums[k] < nums[j]`, and `nums[j] < nums[l]`. 

If there are no quadruplets that meet this condition, the method should return 2. If there is only one quadruplet with indices i, j, k, and l, and `nums[j]` is less than `nums[k]`, the method should return 0. 

The algorithm implemented in the method counts the number of increasing quadruplets in the given array `nums` and returns the result as a long data type.
