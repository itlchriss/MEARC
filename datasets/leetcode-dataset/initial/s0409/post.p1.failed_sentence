The input for the system should strictly be a string.The string passed as a parameter to the method can contain either lowercase or uppercase letters.The length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed using the letters in the string should be determined by the system.The method should consider both lowercase and uppercase letters as potential components of a palindrome.When determining the longest palindrome, the system should consider the same letter in different cases as distinct letters, similar to how the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The string's longest palindrome should be found by the system considering all possible combinations of letters.The output should be the length of the longest palindrome, when the parameter string is passed to the system.
