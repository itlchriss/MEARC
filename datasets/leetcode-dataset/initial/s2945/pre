You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. You can perform any number of operations, where each operation involves selecting a **subarray** of the array and replacing it with the **sum** of its elements. For example, if the given array is `[1,3,5,6]` and you select subarray `[3,5]` the array will convert to `[1,8,6]`. **Explanation:** Replacing [3,2] with [5] converts the given array to [4,5,6] that is non-decreasing. Because the given array is not non-decreasing, the maximum possible answer is 3.
