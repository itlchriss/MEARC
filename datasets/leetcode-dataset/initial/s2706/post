Return _the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two chocolates_. If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending up in debt, return `money`. Note that the leftover must be non-negative. **Explanation:** Purchase the chocolates priced at 1 and 2 units respectively. You will have 3 - 3 = 0 units of money afterwards. Thus, we return 0. **Explanation:** You cannot buy 2 chocolates without going in debt, so we return 3.
