The method should return an integer value representing the sum of numbers represented by the path from the root to each leaf in the binary tree.
If the binary tree is empty (i.e., the root is null), the method should return If the binary tree has only one node (i.e., the root is a leaf), the method should return the value of that node.
The method should consider all leaves in the binary tree and calculate the sum of numbers represented by the path from the root to each leaf.
The method should not modify the binary tree structure or the values of the nodes.
