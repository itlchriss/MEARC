The array `arr` must consist solely of integers and be in the form of an integer array.The condition for the input `arr` is that it must be ensured to be a mountain.The index `i` of the array must be the output, ensuring that it strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples and relates to the parameter array in the method public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr), which is sorted in ascending order.The condition `arr[0] < arr[1] <  .  . .` must be satisfied by the output `i`, where `i` is an integer obtained from the parameter array `arr`.The element at index i in the array is greater than the element at index i - 1 and greater than the element at index i + 1.The value of the last element in the array, accessed using the expression "arr[arr.length - 1]", is being referred to.The index `i` that satisfies the condition can be any valid output.
