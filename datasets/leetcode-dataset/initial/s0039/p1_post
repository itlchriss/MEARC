The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a unique combination of integers from the input array `coins` that sum up to the target `amount`.
The order of the combinations in the returned list does not matter.
Each combination in the returned list should only contain distinct integers.
The sum of integers in each combination should be equal to the target `amount`.
If there are no combinations that sum up to the target `amount`, an empty list should be returned.
