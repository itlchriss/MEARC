If the square with coordinates specified by the parameter "coordinates" in the Java method "squareIsWhite" is black, the method should return the value "false". Conversely, if the square is white, the method should return the value "true". The algorithm should check the color of the square based on the given coordinates and return the corresponding value accordingly.
