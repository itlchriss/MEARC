To solve the problem, we are given a 2D array called `intervals` which represents a collection of intervals. Each interval is represented by a pair of integers `[start_i, end_i]`. Our goal is to merge any overlapping intervals and return a new 2D array that contains non-overlapping intervals covering all the intervals in the input.
