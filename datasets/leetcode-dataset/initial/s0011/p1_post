The method returns an integer representing the maximum area of water that can be contained by the lines.
The maximum area of water is calculated based on the two lines that form the container.
The two lines that form the container are selected in such a way that they, together with the x-axis, form a container that contains the most water.
The container does not slant, meaning the lines are vertical and parallel to the y-axis.
The container is formed by selecting two lines from the given array height, where each line represents a point at coordinate (i, ai) and (i, 0).
