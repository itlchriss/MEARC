The input for the function should consist of a string `s`, as well as integers `power`, `modulo`, `k`, and `hashValue`.The hash value of a substring of length `k` should be computed by the function using the provided `power` and `modulo` values.The computed hash value should be compared with the given `hashValue` by the function.The first substring of length `k` that has a hash value equal to `hashValue` should be returned by the function, where the string `s` is the input string, `power` is the power used for hashing, `modulo` is the modulo value used for hashing, `k` is the length of the substring, and `hashValue` is the desired hash value.If no substring of length `k` in the string `s` has a hash value equal to `hashValue`, then the method should return an empty string.The handling of cases where the computed hash value exceeds the modulo value should be done by taking the modulo of the computed hash value.In the method public String subStrHash(String s, int power, int modulo, int k, int hashValue), the computed hash value should be added to the modulo value to handle cases where the hash value is negative.In the case of an empty string `s`, the expected behavior of the function is to return an empty string.In the case where the value of `k` is greater than the length of `s`, an empty string should be returned by the function.In the case where the length of the string `s` is equal to the value of `k` and the hash value of `s` is equal to the value of `hashValue`, the substring `s` should be returned by the function as the result.
