The minimum number of times needed to make all the computers connected should be calculated by the system.The parameter totalNumberOfComputers represents the total number of computers.The possibility of connecting all the computers should be verified by the system.The parameter totalNumberOfComputers represents the total number of computers.If it is not possible to establish connections between all the computers, the returned value should be -(The system).The minimum number of times needed to connect all the computers should be provided by the system.The parameter totalNumberOfComputers represents the total number of computers.The total number of computers should be capable of being handled by the system.The parameter totalNumberOfComputers represents the total number of computers.The total number of computers should be able to be handled by the system, with different connections between them.The parameter totalNumberOfComputers represents the total number of computers.The current state of the computers and their connections should be taken into consideration by the system.The most efficient sequence of actions to connect all the computers should be ascertained by the system.The frequency of the action being executed should be recorded by the system.The parameter totalNumberOfComputers represents the total number of computers.After each action is taken, the state of the computers and their connections should be updated by the system.The action of continuing to perform actions until all the computers are connected, determining that it is not possible, should be done by the system.The parameter totalNumberOfComputers represents the total number of computers.The output should clearly indicate the minimum number of times needed for the system to provide a clear and understandable output. If it is not possible, the output should be -1.The parameter totalNumberOfComputers represents the total number of computers.
