The integer `n` represents the input, while the integer arrays `left` and `right` represent the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right respectively.The length of the plank, assumed to be a straight line, is represented by the integer `n`.The integers representing the positions of the ants are moved in a single direction, either left or right, at a constant speed.The determination and return of the moment when the ant(s) that reach the end of the plank is referred to as the last ant(s) falling out of the plank, and this moment needs to be determined and returned as an output.While moving on the plank, the ants maintain their direction, avoid collisions with each other, and prevent falling off the plank before reaching the end.
