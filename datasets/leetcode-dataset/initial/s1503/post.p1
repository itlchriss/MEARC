To determine the exact moment when the last ant or ants fall off the plank, we need to consider an integer `n` representing the length of the plank, as well as two integer arrays `left` and `right` indicating the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right, respectively. By analyzing the algorithm, we can find the precise moment when the last ant or ants fall off the plank.
