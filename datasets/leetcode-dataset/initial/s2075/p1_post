The method should return a string value.
The returned string value should be the original text that was encoded.
The length of the returned string value should be equal to the length of the `encodedText` parameter.
The returned string value should be formed by reading the characters from the encoded text in a specific pattern based on the number of rows specified.
The characters in the returned string value should be arranged in rows, with each row containing a specific number of characters.
The characters in each row should be read from left to right.
If the number of characters in the encoded text is not evenly divisible by the number of rows, the last row should contain fewer characters.
The characters in each row should be concatenated to form the final decoded string.
