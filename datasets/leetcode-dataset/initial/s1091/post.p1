The size of the input binary matrix `grid` is `n x n`.The length of the shortest clear path in the matrix is the output.If the parameter grid does not contain a clear path, the output is -A clear path is a path in the matrix that consists only of 0s.The number of steps required to traverse the path determines the length of the path.The grid must only allow horizontal or vertical movement, not diagonal movement.The matrix must have any cell as the starting point for the path.The matrix can have its path ending at any cell.The cells with a value of 1 (obstacles) cannot be crossed by the path.The cell can be visited multiple times by the path.The cells can be revisited and the path can backtrack.The direction of the path can change at any point, regardless of the parameters of the array.The path should be able to go through cells with a value of 0. The path should not be able to go through cells with a value of 1. The method should return the length of the shortest clear path.
