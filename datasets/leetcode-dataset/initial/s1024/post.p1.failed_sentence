The clips array should be sorted in ascending order, and the time parameter should represent the entire sporting event. The system should then be able to calculate the minimum number of clips needed to cover the event.The array clips is not null, and the parameter time is used to sort it in ascending order.The clips in the parameter array should be able to be cut into segments by the system.The array clips is sorted in ascending order, and the integer time is not null.The possibility of covering the entire sporting event with the provided clips can be determined by the system.The array clips is not null, and the parameter time is used to sort it in ascending order.If it is impossible to cover the entire sporting event, the system should return -1.The array clips is not null, and the parameter time is used to sort it in ascending order.The number of clips needed to cover the entire sporting event should be returned by the system as the minimum.The array clips is not null, and the parameter time is used to sort it in ascending order.The time range of [0, time] should be handled by the system.The array clips is not null, and the parameter time is used to sort it in ascending order.
