A class named "str_numArray" should be present in the system, which should contain a method called "sumRange".The method str_sumRange should have two integer parameters, "left" and "right", which strictly adhere to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." These parameters should be explicitly related to the terms "public NumArray(int[] nums)", "public void update(int index, int val)", and "public int sumRange(int left, int right)".The returned value of the str_sumRange method should strictly be an integer, and it should not be null.The sum of the elements in the "nums" array, including both the "left" and "right" indices, should be calculated by the str_sumRange method.The sum calculation in the str_sumRange method should include the element at index "left" and the element at index "right".The calculation of the sum in the str_sumRange method is performed by adding the elements in the "nums" array, specifically from the index "left" to the index "right".The method sumRange should handle scenarios where the value of the parameter "left" is greater than the value of the parameter "right" and should return a result that is appropriate for this situation.The condition of "left" and "right" being out of bounds of the "nums" array should be handled by the str_sumRange method, ensuring that an appropriate result is returned.The case where the "nums" array is empty should be handled by the str_sumRange method, and it should return a result that is appropriate for this situation.The handling of cases where the "nums" array contains negative numbers and the appropriate result returned should be ensured by the str_sumRange method.The handling of cases where the "nums" array contains floating-point numbers and the appropriate result returned should be ensured by the str_sumRange method.The case where the "nums" array contains large numbers should be handled by the str_sumRange method, and it should return a result that is appropriate for this situation.The handling of cases where the "nums" array contains duplicate numbers and the appropriate result returned should be ensured by the str_sumRange method.The handling of cases where the "nums" array contains zero should be done by the str_sumRange method, and it should return a result that is appropriate.The handling of cases where the "nums" array contains both positive and negative numbers and the appropriate result returned should be ensured by the str_sumRange method.The method should appropriately handle cases where the array "nums" contains both integers and floating-point numbers and should return a result that is suitable for the given situation.The method sumRange should be able to handle scenarios where the array nums contains both small and large numbers and should return a result that is appropriate for the given situation.The method should appropriately handle cases where the array "nums" contains both ascending and descending numbers and should return a result that is suitable for the given situation.The array "nums" should contain both even and odd numbers, and the str_sumRange method should handle these cases and return a suitable result.The method should handle cases where the array "nums" contains both prime and composite numbers and should return a result that is appropriate.
