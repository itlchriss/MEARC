Given a positive integer `k`, return _the number of **different** ways to reach the position_ `endPos` _starting from_ `startPos`_, such that you perform **exactly**_ `k` _steps_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.
You are given two **positive** integers `startPos` and `endPos`. Initially, you are standing at position `startPos` on an **infinite** number line. With one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the right.
