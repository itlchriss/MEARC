Given a positive integer `k`, return _the number of **different** ways to reach the position_ `endPos` _starting from_ `startPos`_, such that you perform **exactly**_ `k` _steps_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>. It can be proven that no other way is possible, so we return 3.
