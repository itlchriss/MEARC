The method returns a TreeNode object representing the root of the constructed binary tree.
The binary tree constructed has the same elements as the `inorder` and `postorder` arrays.
The binary tree constructed follows the inorder and postorder traversal rules.
The left subtree of any node in the binary tree is constructed using the elements in the `inorder` and `postorder` arrays that come before the current node's element.
The right subtree of any node in the binary tree is constructed using the elements in the `inorder` and `postorder` arrays that come after the current node's element.
