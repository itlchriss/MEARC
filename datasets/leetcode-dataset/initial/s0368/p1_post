The method returns a list of integers.
The returned list `answer` is a subset of the input array `nums`.
For every pair `(answer[i], answer[j])` of elements in the returned list `answer`, `answer[i]` is divisible by `answer[j]`.
The returned list `answer` is the largest subset that satisfies the above condition.
If there are multiple solutions, any of them can be returned.
