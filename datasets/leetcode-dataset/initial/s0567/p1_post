The method should return a boolean value, `true` or `false`.
If `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, the method should return `true`.
If `s2` does not contain a permutation of `s1`, the method should return `false`.
The method should consider all possible permutations of `s1`.
The method should check if any of the permutations of `s1` is a substring of `s2`.
