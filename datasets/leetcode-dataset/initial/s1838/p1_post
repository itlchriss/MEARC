The method returns an integer representing the maximum possible frequency of an element.
The maximum possible frequency is obtained by performing at most `k` operations.
An operation can be defined as incrementing or decrementing the value of an element in the array `nums` by - The frequency of an element is the number of times it appears in the array `nums`.
The maximum possible frequency is the highest frequency achievable after performing at most `k` operations.
