The method should return an integer representing the maximum number of water bottles that can be consumed.
The maximum number of water bottles should be calculated based on the given `numBottles` and `numExchange`.
If `numBottles` is less than or equal to 0, the method should return - If `numExchange` is less than or equal to 1, the method should return `numBottles`.
If `numBottles` is greater than 0 and `numExchange` is greater than 1, the method should calculate the maximum number of water bottles that can be consumed by exchanging empty bottles for new bottles.
The method should consider the possibility of having remaining empty bottles after exchanging for new bottles and include them in the calculation of the maximum number of water bottles.
The method should handle the case where the number of empty bottles is not enough to exchange for a new bottle and return the maximum number of water bottles that can be consumed in this scenario.
