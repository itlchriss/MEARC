Preconditions:
The method takes two integer parameters, m and n, representing the dimensions of the grid.
The values of m and n are positive integers.
The grid has m rows and n columns.
The grid is empty initially, with no colors assigned to any cell.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the number of ways to color the grid.
The returned value is the number of valid colorings of the grid, where no two adjacent cells have the same color.
The returned value is calculated modulo 10^9 + 7 to handle large numbers.
