The input accepted by the system should be a positive integer `n`.The count of integers within the range `[0, n]` should be calculated by the system.The binary representation of each integer in the range `[0, n]` should be converted by the system.The condition to be checked is whether the binary representation of each integer in the parameter array contains consecutive ones.The count of integers, whose binary representations do not contain consecutive ones, should be determined by the system.The count of integers whose binary representations do not contain consecutive ones should be returned by the system as output.
