initial prepare.sh run.sh `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns `""`. timeMap.get("foo", 1); // return "bar" timeMap.get("foo", 3); // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 timeMap.get("foo", 4); // return "bar2" timeMap.get("foo", 5); // return "bar2"
