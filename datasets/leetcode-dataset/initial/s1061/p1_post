The method should return a string that is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.
The returned string should have the same length as baseStr.
The returned string should be formed by replacing each character in baseStr with its equivalent character from s1 and s2, based on the equivalency information.
The equivalency information from s1 and s2 should be used to determine the replacement characters in the returned string.
The lexicographically smallest equivalent string should be determined by comparing the characters in the returned string in lexicographical order.
