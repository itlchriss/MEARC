You are given two strings of the same length `s1` and `s2` and a string `baseStr`. For example, given the equivalency information from `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "cde"`, `"acd"` and `"aab"` are equivalent strings of `baseStr = "eed"`, and `"aab"` is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr`.
