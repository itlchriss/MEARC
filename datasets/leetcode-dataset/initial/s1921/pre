You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of `n` monsters. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `dist` of size `n`, where `dist[i]` is the initial distance** in kilometers of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> monster from the city. The monsters walk toward the city at a **constant** speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array `speed` of size `n`, where `speed[i]` is the speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> monster in kilometers per minute.
