To achieve the count of unique characters in the string `s`, we should implement a function called `countUniqueChars(s)`. Our objective is to calculate the sum of `countUniqueChars(t)` for each substring `t` within `s`. The term "we" in the second sentence refers to the same group of people mentioned in the first sentence. This pronoun is used to indicate that the speaker and the group they belong to share a common goal or intention. The usage of "we" clearly applies to the context of the given Java method, `public int uniqueLetterString(String s)`, and explicitly relates to all parameters and the result data type of the method. The sentence avoids any dangling modifiers, pronouns, or direct mention of the given method, and instead uses descriptive words to explain the algorithm.
