There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a **unique** color. You are given a 2D integer array `segments`, where <code>segments[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the **half-closed segment** <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code> with <code>color<sub>i</sub></code> as the color.
