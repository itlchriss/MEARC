If the number of batteries is greater than or equal to n, the maximum running time of the system should be limited to 4 minutes.- In the context of the method public long maxRunTime(int n, int[] batteries), the term "str_it" specifically denotes the system.The integer parameter n represents the number of batteries, and the integer array parameter batteries represents the battery capacities.If the number of batteries is greater than or equal to 2, the maximum running time of the system should be limited to 2 minutes.- In the context of the method public long maxRunTime(int n, int[] batteries), the term "str_it" specifically denotes the system.The integer parameter n represents the number of batteries, and the integer array parameter batteries represents the battery levels.The ability of the system to determine the maximum number of minutes it can run all the 'n' computers simultaneously is contingent upon the sorting of the parameter array in ascending order.- In the context of the method public long maxRunTime(int n, int[] batteries), the term "str_it" specifically denotes the system.
