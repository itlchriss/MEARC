Preconditions:
- The method takes two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of computers and an array `batteries` representing the battery life of each computer.
- The array `batteries` should have a length equal to `n`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long value representing the maximum number of minutes that all `n` computers can run simultaneously.
- The returned value should be the maximum battery life among all computers.
