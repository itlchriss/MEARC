The returned array `answer` is not null.
The length of the returned array `answer` is equal to the length of the input array `queries`.
Each element in the returned array `answer` is a non-negative integer.
The maximum size of a subsequence that can be taken from `nums` such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `queries[i]` is stored in `answer[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`.
