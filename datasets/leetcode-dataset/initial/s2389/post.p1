The length of the resulting array should strictly be `m`, where `m` is a specified value.The maximum size of a subsequence should be represented by each element in the output array, given that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order and the result is not null.The subsequence should be taken from the array `nums` provided as input.The subsequence's element sum should be less than or equal to the corresponding element in the `queries` array, given that the `nums` array is used as input.The number of elements in the subsequence is referred to as its size.The size of the subsequence that should be determined is the maximum.The array of answers to the queries should be returned.
