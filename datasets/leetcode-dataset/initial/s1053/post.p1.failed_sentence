To find the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than the given array `arr` and can be made with exactly one swap, we need to implement an algorithm in Java. This algorithm takes an array of positive integers `arr` (which may contain duplicates) as input and returns an array of integers as the result. If it is not possible to make such a permutation, the algorithm should return the same array.
