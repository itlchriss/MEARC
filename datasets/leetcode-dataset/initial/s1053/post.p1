Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` is not null.
- The input array `arr` contains only positive integers.

Postconditions:
- The returned array is the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than the input array `arr`.
- The returned array can be made with exactly one swap.
- If it is not possible to create a lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than the input array `arr` with exactly one swap, then the same array is returned.
