To ensure proper functioning of the system, a function that accepts an array of queries as input is necessary, where the array is sorted in ascending order and the result is not null.The output should be a boolean array, which can be achieved by returning a result that is not null. Additionally, the input parameter array should be sorted in ascending order.Furthermore, each query from the input array must be processed individually, while strictly adhering to the syntax of the given examples and without using any pronouns or dangling modifiers.Afterwards, the evaluation of the result of each query should be performed, where the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.Storing the result of each query in the boolean array as a consequence is necessary.The `i`th element of the boolean array should be assigned the result of the `i`th query, in addition to that.The input array should be sorted in ascending order, and it should have the ability to manage numerous queries.The capability to manage various forms of inquiries ought to be possessed, in addition to the fact that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.Moreover, the ability to handle different values for each query is a requirement.The capability to manage various sizes of the input array must be present.Furthermore, the input arrays that are empty should be managed by the method, and it should have the capability to do so.Furthermore, the input array should be capable of handling invalid queries.Furthermore, the capability to handle invalid values for each query should be present.Furthermore, it is necessary to have the ability to handle invalid sizes for the input array in order to ensure that the result is not null and the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.Finally, the null_value should be handled in cases where the input array is the null_value.
