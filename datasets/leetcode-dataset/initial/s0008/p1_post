The method should return an integer value.
The returned integer should be a 32-bit signed integer.
The method should ignore any leading whitespace in the input string.
The method should check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. If present, it should determine if the final result is negative or positive respectively.
The method should read the next characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string should be ignored.
The method should convert the read digits into an integer. If no digits were read, the integer should be The sign should be changed as necessary.
If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], it should be clamped to remain in the range. Integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
