The output `answer` is an array of integers.
The length of `answer` is equal to the length of `seq`.
Each element in `answer` is either 0 or - If `seq[i]` is part of `A`, then `answer[i]` is - If `seq[i]` is part of `B`, then `answer[i]` is - There may be multiple valid choices for `A` and `B`, so the returned `answer` can be any valid choice.
