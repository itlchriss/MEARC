The array `answer` should be returned by the function with the same length as the input array `seq`.Each element in the `answer` array should have a value of either 0 or 1. If an element in the `seq` array is included in `A`, then the corresponding element in the `answer` array should be 0. If an element in the `seq` array is not included in `A`, then the corresponding element in the `answer` array should be 1. The function should be able to handle cases where there are multiple possible answers.The answer can be any valid result, as long as the parameter sequence is split into two arrays with maximum depth.
