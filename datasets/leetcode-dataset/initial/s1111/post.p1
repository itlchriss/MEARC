The Java method `maxDepthAfterSplit(String seq)` should return an array called `answer` with a length equal to the length of the input sequence `seq`. This array encodes a choice of two sets, `A` and `B`, where each element in `seq` is assigned a value in `answer`. If an element in `seq` is part of set `A`, then the corresponding value in `answer` should be 0. Otherwise, if the element is not part of set `A`, the value in `answer` should be 1. It is important to note that there may be multiple valid choices for `A` and `B`, so any valid choice can be returned.
