The sequence [1 , 2] ,  [1 , 4] ,  [1 , 6] ,  [7 , 2] ,  [7 , 4] ,  [11 , 2] ,  [7 , 6] ,  [11 , 4] , and [11 , 6] should be returned as the first 3 pairs by the system.The sequence [1 , 1] ,  [1 , 1] ,  [1 , 2] ,  [2 , 1] ,  [1 , 2] ,  [2 , 2] ,  [1 , 3] ,  [1 , 3] ,  and [2 , 3] should be returned as the first 2 pairs by the system.The sequence [1 , 3] and [2 , 3] should be used as input parameters, and the system should return all possible pairs from this sequence.The k pairs with the smallest sums should be returned by the system.The pairs should be returned by the system in the format (u1, v1). The pairs should also be returned in the format (u2, v2). Additionally, the pairs should be returned in the format (uk, vk). The pairs should only be returned in this format if and only if the parameter array nums1 and nums2 are sorted in ascending order.
