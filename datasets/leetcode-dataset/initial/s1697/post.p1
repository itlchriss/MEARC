In the given Java method, which includes the public Dsu(int n), public int find(int num), public void union(int a, int b), and public boolean[] distanceLimitedPathsExist(int n, int[][] edgeList, int[][] queries), we need to ensure that the pronouns in the sentence are split into sentences with consistent sentence structure and subject, using verbs in simple present tense. We should not use coordinating conjunctions and conjunctive adverbs, except for "str_if". 

For the first query, if there is no path between 0 and 1 and each distance is less than 2, we return the false_value. 

However, for the second query, a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) exists, which consists of two edges with distances less than 5. As a result, we affirm the truthfulness of this query. 

To summarize, we need to return a boolean array called 'answer', where the length of the answer should be equal to the length of 'queries'. 

Furthermore, the jth value of the answer should indicate the true_value if there exists a path for 'queries[j]', and the false_value if not. 

By following this approach, we can clearly apply the given sentence to the context of the Java method and explicitly relate the used terms to all parameters and result data type of the given method. Additionally, we avoid using dangling modifiers, pronouns, and mentioning the given method, while using words to describe the algorithm.
