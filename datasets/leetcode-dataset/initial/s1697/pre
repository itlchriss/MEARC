Given an array `queries`, where <code>queries[j] = [p<sub>j</sub>, q<sub>j</sub>, limit<sub>j</sub>]</code>, your task is to determine for each `queries[j]` whether there is a path between <code>p<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>q<sub>j</sub></code> such that each edge on the path has a distance **strictly less than** <code>limit<sub>j</sub></code> .
**Explanation:** The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16. **Output:** [true,false] **Exaplanation:** The above figure shows the given graph.
