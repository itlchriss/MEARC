Preconditions:
- The input `paths` is a non-null 2D array of strings representing the paths of folders in a file system.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a non-null 2D array `ans` containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders.
- The order of the paths in the returned `ans` array may be different from the order in the input `paths` array, as the order does not matter.
