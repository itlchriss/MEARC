The method should take in eight integer parameters representing the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.
The coordinates of the rectangles should be in the form of (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) represents the top-left corner and (x2, y2) represents the bottom-right corner of each rectangle.
The coordinates should be valid and within the range of integer values.
