Preconditions:
The method should take in eight integer parameters representing the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.
The coordinates of the rectangles should be in the form of (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) represents the top-left corner and (x2, y2) represents the bottom-right corner of each rectangle.
The coordinates should be valid and within the range of integer values.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the total area covered by the two rectangles.
The area should be calculated by finding the overlapping area between the two rectangles.
If there is no overlap between the rectangles, the method should return The method should handle cases where one rectangle is completely inside the other rectangle.
The method should handle cases where the rectangles share only a single point or a single line.
The method should handle cases where the rectangles share a common area but are not completely overlapping.
The method should handle cases where the rectangles are adjacent to each other but do not overlap.
The method should handle cases where the rectangles are disjoint and do not share any common area.
The method should handle cases where the rectangles have negative coordinates.
The method should handle cases where the rectangles have overlapping coordinates, such as (x1 > x2) or (y1 > y2).
The method should handle cases where the rectangles have zero area, such as when the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same.
