You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing the dimensions of a **0-indexed** `m x n` grid. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `coordinates`, where `coordinates[i] = [x, y]` indicates that the cell with coordinates `[x, y]` is colored **black**. All cells in the grid that do not appear in `coordinates` are **white**.
