Create a Java method called 'evenOddBit' that takes an integer parameter 'n' and returns an array of integers named 'answer'. The 'answer' array should contain two elements, where the first element represents the count of even numbers and the second element represents the count of odd numbers obtained from the 'n' parameter.
