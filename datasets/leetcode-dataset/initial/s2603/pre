There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array edges of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given an array `coins` of size `n` where `coins[i]` can be either `0` or `1`, where `1` indicates the presence of a coin in the vertex `i`.
