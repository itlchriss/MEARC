Preconditions:
- The input strings `a` and `b` are not null.
- The input strings `a` and `b` are not empty.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the minimum number of times `a` should be repeated so that `b` is a substring of it.
- If it is impossible for `b` to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, the method returns -1.
