The 0-indexed integer array called `nums` is the input.The boolean value, either `true` or `false`, represents the output.If the array `nums` is sorted in ascending order, the result is `true`.The condition of the array `nums` being able to become strictly increasing after removing exactly one element results in the return value of `true`.If the array `nums` is not able to be made strictly increasing by removing exactly one element, the method should return `false`.The array `nums` can undergo modification by the removal of precisely one element, resulting in a potential change in its ascending order.The array obtained after eliminating an element must be strictly increasing, just like the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The length of the resulting array, obtained by removing an element, should be less than the length of the original array `nums`.The length of the resulting array after removing an element should be greater than or equal to the length of the parameter array. Additionally, the resulting array after removing an element should not include any duplicate elements.The array obtained after removing an element should be sorted in ascending order.The array obtained after removing an element should not contain any element that is equal to or less than the element at the same index in the original array `nums`.The array obtained after removing an element should not contain any element that is equal to or greater than the element at the next index in the original array `nums`.The array obtained after removing an element should not contain any element that is equal to or less than the element at the previous index in the original array `nums`.The array obtained after removing an element should not contain any element that is equal to or greater than the element at the same index in the original array `nums`.
