Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, return `true` _if it can be made **strictly increasing** after removing **exactly one** element, or_ `false` _otherwise. If the array is already strictly increasing, return_ `true`. **Explanation:** By removing 10 at index 2 from nums, it becomes [1,2,5,7]. [1,2,5,7] is strictly increasing, so return true. No resulting array is strictly increasing, so return false. **Explanation:** The result of removing any element is [1,1]. [1,1] is not strictly increasing, so return false.
