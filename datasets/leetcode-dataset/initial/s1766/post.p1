Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `edges` is not null.
- The length of `nums` is equal to the length of `edges`.
- The length of `nums` is greater than 
Postconditions:
- The returned array `ans` is not null.
- The length of `ans` is equal to the length of `nums`.
- For each index `i` in `ans`, `ans[i]` is the closest ancestor to node `i` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[ans[i]]` are coprime.
- If there is no such ancestor for a node `i`, `ans[i]` is -1.
