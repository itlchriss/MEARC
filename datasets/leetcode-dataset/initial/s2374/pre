You are given a directed graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has **exactly one** outgoing edge. The graph is represented by a given **0-indexed** integer array `edges` of length `n`, where `edges[i]` indicates that there is a **directed** edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.
