Preconditions:
The input list `nums` must not be null.
The input list `nums` must not be empty.
The input integer `k` must be non-negative.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer that represents the sum of elements in `nums` whose corresponding indices have exactly `k` set bits in their binary representation.
If there are no elements in `nums` whose corresponding indices have exactly `k` set bits, the method should return 0.
