The integer `rowIndex` should be used as the input.The `rowIndexth` row of Pascal's triangle should be the output.The `rowIndex` must be an integer that is greater than or equal to zero.The list representing the row of Pascal's triangle should be the output.The row in the `getRow` method should be 0-indexed, indicating that the first row is at index 0. The row should also have the correct number of elements based on the `rowIndex` parameter.The pattern of Pascal's triangle should be followed by the elements in the row.The integers in the row should be the elements.The calculation of the elements in the row should be based on the previous row(s) of Pascal's triangle.The elements in the calculation should strictly adhere to the rules of Pascal's triangle.
