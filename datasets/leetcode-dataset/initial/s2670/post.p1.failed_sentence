The distinct difference array of the input array `nums` should be calculated by the system.The output should be the distinct difference array, which the system should return.The distinct difference array should have each element unique, and the system should ensure this.The input array `nums` should have its elements compared to calculate the difference between each pair of elements.The distinct difference array should be excluded from any duplicate differences by the system.Arrays with different sizes as input should be handled by the system.The input array should contain both positive and negative numbers, and the system should handle it.The input array should be handled by the system when it contains zero.The input array, which is sorted in ascending order, should be handled by the system, even if it contains repeating elements.The input array should be handled as empty by the system.The input array should be handled by the system, even if it contains only one element.
