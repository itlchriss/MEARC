**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores). **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.
