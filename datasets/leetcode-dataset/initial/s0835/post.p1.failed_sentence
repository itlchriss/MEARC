The overlap between two entities should be determined by the system.The largest overlap among all possible overlaps should be identified by the system.The output should be the largest possible overlap, and it should be returned by the system.The method should consider all possible combinations of overlaps between the arrays img1 and img2 in order to determine the largest one.The method should prioritize finding the largest overlap between the arrays img1 and img2 over other possible overlaps.The response should be appropriate when there is no overlap between the entities, and the system should handle these cases.
