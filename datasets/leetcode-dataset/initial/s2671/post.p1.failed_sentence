A data structure for storing numbers should be present in the system.The method `hasFrequency` should be present in the system and it should accept an integer parameter named `frequency`.The boolean value should be returned by the `hasFrequency` method.The `hasFrequency` method ought to yield `true` if there exists a number in the data structure that appears `frequency` times.The condition of returning `false` by the `hasFrequency` method is when there is no number in the data structure that occurs `frequency` number of times.When the frequency of the number 3 occurs twice in the data structure, the system should return `true` when calling `hasFrequency` with a frequency of 2.When the data structure is empty, calling `hasFrequency` with a frequency of 1 should result in the system returning `false`.When the data structure is empty, calling `hasFrequency` with a frequency of 2 should result in the system returning `false`.When the frequency of the number 3 occurs once in the data structure, the system should return `true` when calling `hasFrequency` with a frequency of 1.
