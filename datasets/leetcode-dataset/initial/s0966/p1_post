The method returns an array of strings.
The returned array contains the correct word for each query in the queries array.
The returned array has the same length as the queries array.
If a query word matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), the query word is returned with the same case as the word in the wordlist.
If a query word matches a word in the wordlist after replacing the vowels individually, the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
If a query word exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), the same word is returned.
If a query word matches a word in the wordlist up to capitalization, the first such match in the wordlist is returned.
If a query word matches a word in the wordlist up to vowel errors, the first such match in the wordlist is returned.
If a query word has no matches in the wordlist, the empty string is returned.
