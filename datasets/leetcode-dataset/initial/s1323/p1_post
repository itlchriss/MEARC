The returned number should be the maximum number that can be obtained by changing at most one digit in `num`.
The returned number should have the same number of digits as the input number `num`.
If the input number `num` does not contain any digit 6 or 9, the returned number should be the same as the input number `num`.
If the input number `num` contains only the digit 6 or only the digit 9, the returned number should be the same as the input number `num` with the digit 6 replaced by 9 or vice versa.
If the input number `num` contains both the digit 6 and the digit 9, the returned number should be the same as the input number `num` with the leftmost occurrence of the digit 6 replaced by 9 or vice versa.
