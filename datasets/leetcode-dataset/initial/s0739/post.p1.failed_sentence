Accepting an array of integers as its input, the input for the system should be an array of integers.The method should determine the number of days one must wait for a warmer temperature after each day by calculating the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature after each day, using the parameter array.The array called `answer` should store the results, with the results being saved in an array named `answer`, for the method public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) where the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.In the case where there is no subsequent day with a higher temperature, the system should assign a value of 0 to `answer[i]` in order to indicate this.The `answer` array should be returned by the system as the output, with the `temperatures` array provided as the input.
