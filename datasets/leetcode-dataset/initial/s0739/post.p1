The method `dailyTemperatures` takes an array of integers `temperatures` as input, which represents the daily temperatures. It returns an array `answer` as output. Each element `answer[i]` in this array represents the number of days one has to wait after the `i`th day to get a warmer temperature.

If there is no future day for which a warmer temperature is possible, the value of `answer[i]` is set to 0.
