Let's assume that a set of deletion indices, denoted as `answer`, is selected. This set is chosen in a manner that, after performing the deletions, the resulting array will have all the strings (rows) arranged in lexicographic order. In simpler terms, each string in the array must satisfy the condition `(strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ... <= strs[0][strs[0].length 1])`, and the same condition should hold for subsequent strings in the array. 

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible length of the `answer` set.
