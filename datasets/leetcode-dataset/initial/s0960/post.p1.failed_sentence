The minimum number of deletions required to arrange the strings in lexicographic order should be determined by the algorithm.The iteration should be performed by the algorithm through each string in the array, ensuring strict adherence to the syntax of the given examples and explicitly relating the parameters to the terms in it, without mentioning the method public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs).The comparison of each character in a string to the corresponding character in the previous string should be performed by the algorithm.If the character in the current string is greater than the character in the previous string, there is no need for any deletion to be performed, as the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.If the character in the current string is less than the character in the previous string, a deletion is required.The number of deletions required should be kept track of by the algorithm.The minimum number of deletions required should be returned by the algorithm.
