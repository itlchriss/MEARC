Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return _an array of all the integers in the range_ `[1, n]` _that do not appear in_ `nums`. **Follow up:** Could you do it without extra space and in `O(n)` runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
