The method `findDisappearedNumbers` takes an array `nums` of `n` integers as input, where each integer `nums[i]` is in the range `[1 ,  n]`. It returns an array of integers that do not appear in the input array `nums`. The algorithm should be implemented without using any extra space and should have a runtime complexity of `O(n)`. The returned list is not considered as extra space.
