The input for the function should be an array `nums` containing `n` integers.The range of integers in the array `nums` is from 1 to n, and the returned array will consist of integers.The array returned by the method should include all the integers in the range `[1 ,  n]` that are not present in the array `nums`. The runtime complexity of the method should be `O(n)`.The function should avoid using any extra space, except for the list that is returned, when finding the disappeared numbers in the sorted ascending order parameter array.
