The input for the function should consist of two integers, `left` and `right`, which will be used as the lower and upper bounds, respectively.The list of self-dividing numbers should be returned by the function, where the numbers are within the range specified by the parameters left and right.Within the range `[left ,  right]`, the numbers that are self-dividing should be considered.A range of self-dividing numbers is a range of numbers where each number is divisible by all of its digits, and the range is defined by the parameters left and right.The list of numbers that are divisible by themselves and have no remainder when divided by any digit within the range from the left parameter to the right parameter should be arranged in ascending order.If the range `[left, right]` does not contain any self-dividing numbers, an empty list should be returned.
