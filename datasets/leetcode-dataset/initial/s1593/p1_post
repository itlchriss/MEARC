The method returns an integer value representing the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.
The method does not modify the input string `s`.
The method considers all possible substrings of the input string `s` for splitting.
The method counts a substring as unique only if it has not been encountered before during the splitting process.
The method returns 0 if the input string `s` does not have any unique substrings.
The method returns 1 if the input string `s` does not have any repeated characters.
The method returns the maximum number of unique substrings even if they overlap with each other.
The method returns the maximum number of unique substrings even if they are of different lengths.
The method returns the maximum number of unique substrings even if they are not contiguous in the original string `s`.
The method returns the maximum number of unique substrings even if they are not in the same order as in the original string `s`.
