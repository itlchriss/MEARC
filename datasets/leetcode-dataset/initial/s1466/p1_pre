The method should take two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of cities and a 2D array `connections` representing the roads between cities.
The value of `n` should be greater than or equal to The length of the `connections` array should be greater than or equal to Each element in the `connections` array should be an array of length 2, representing a road between two cities.
