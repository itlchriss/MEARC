Preconditions:
The method should take two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of cities and a 2D array `connections` representing the roads between cities.
The value of `n` should be greater than or equal to The length of the `connections` array should be greater than or equal to Each element in the `connections` array should be an array of length 2, representing a road between two cities.
The cities are represented by integers from 0 to n-The roads in the `connections` array should be valid, i.e., they should connect existing cities.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer representing the minimum number of edges that need to be changed to ensure that each city can visit city The returned value should be non-negative.
If all cities can already visit city 0, the method should return The method should not modify the original `connections` array.
The method should not modify the values of `n` or any other variables outside its scope.
