Preconditions:
The method should take two integer parameters, `low` and `high`.
The value of `low` should be less than or equal to the value of `high`.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the number of symmetric integers in the range `[low, high]`.
The returned value should be greater than or equal to If there are no symmetric integers in the range `[low, high]`, the method should return 0.
