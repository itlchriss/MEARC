The method returns an array of integers called `ans`.
The length of the `ans` array is equal to the number of queries.
For each query `i`, the value of `ans[i]` represents the index of the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet.
If Alice and Bob cannot move to a common building on query `i`, the value of `ans[i]` is set to -1.
