You will walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. Whenever you move outside the grid's boundary, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.). Eventually, we reach all `rows initial prepare.sh run.sh cols` spaces of the grid.
Return _an array of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order you visited them_.
