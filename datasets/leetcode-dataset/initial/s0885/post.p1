Preconditions:
- The input values `rows`, `cols`, `y`, and `x` are valid and within the grid's boundaries.
- The grid is not empty.

Postconditions:
- The returned array `int[][]` contains coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.
- The length of the returned array is equal to the total number of spaces in the grid (`rows * cols`).
- The coordinates in the returned array are valid and within the grid's boundaries.
- The coordinates in the returned array are in the order they were visited, following a clockwise spiral shape.
- If a position in the grid is visited multiple times (due to moving outside the grid's boundary and returning later), it appears multiple times in the returned array.
