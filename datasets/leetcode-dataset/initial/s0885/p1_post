The returned array `int[][]` contains coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.
The length of the returned array is equal to the total number of spaces in the grid (`rows * cols`).
The coordinates in the returned array are valid and within the grid's boundaries.
The coordinates in the returned array are in the order they were visited, following a clockwise spiral shape.
Whenever the walk reaches the boundary of the grid, it continues outside the grid but may return to the grid boundary later.
