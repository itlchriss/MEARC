Preconditions:
The method should take two string parameters, `str1` and `str2`.
The strings `str1` and `str2` should not be null.
The strings `str1` and `str2` should not be empty.

Postconditions:
The method should return a string `x` that is the largest string which divides both `str1` and `str2`.
The string `x` should be a substring of both `str1` and `str2`.
The string `x` should be a divisor of both `str1` and `str2`, meaning that both `str1` and `str2` can be divided evenly by `x`.
If there is no common divisor for `str1` and `str2`, the method should return an empty string.
