The number of moves required to acquire all keys should be calculated by the system.The possibility of acquiring all keys should be checked by the system.If it is impossible to acquire all keys, the lowest number of moves required to acquire all keys should be returned.The lowest number of moves to acquire all keys should be calculated by the system when handling multiple requests, with the parameter array being sorted in ascending order.The array of strings representing the grid should contain different scenarios and configurations of keys, and the system should handle them.The calculation of the lowest number of moves should take into account the current position of the player, when considering the parameter array.The calculation of the lowest number of moves should take into account the location of the keys.The number of moves required to acquire all keys should be considered by the system, taking into account any obstacles or barriers that may affect it.The algorithm provided by the system should efficiently calculate the lowest number of moves required, given a sorted array of keys in ascending order.The stringGrid parameter represents an array that is sorted in ascending order.The system strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples, ensuring that the result is not null. Additionally, the system ensures that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.
