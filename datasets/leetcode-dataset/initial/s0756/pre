Given `bottom` and `allowed`, return `true` _if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that **every triangular pattern** in the pyramid is in_ `allowed`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.
To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific **triangular patterns** that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a **single block** stacked on top of **two blocks**. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings `allowed`, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block. You start with a bottom row of blocks `bottom`, given as a single string, that you **must** use as the base of the pyramid.
