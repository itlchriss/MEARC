The method should be capable of efficiently handling an `m x n` matrix as input, where the matrix can include positive and negative values, decimal values, duplicate values, all elements being the same value, an empty matrix, a matrix with only one row or one column, a matrix with different numbers of rows and columns, different data types for its elements, missing or incomplete data, a large number of rows and columns efficiently, a very small number of rows and columns efficiently, a very large range of values efficiently, and a very small range of values efficiently.The array of parameters, matrix, is arranged in ascending order.The matrixRankTransform method should generate a new matrix named `answer` with the same size as the input matrix.The array of parameters, matrix, is arranged in ascending order.The rank of each element in the `answer` matrix should be determined by its value in the input matrix, and each element in the `answer` matrix should represent the rank of the corresponding element in the input matrix, where the input matrix is an array sorted in ascending order.The matrix passed as a parameter is not null. 
The matrix passed as a parameter is sorted in ascending order.The calculation of the rank of an element in the input matrix should be based on its position, considering both the row and column. The resulting rank should always be an integer value.
