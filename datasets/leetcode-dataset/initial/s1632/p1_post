The output matrix must have the same dimensions as the input matrix.
The values in the output matrix must represent the rank of the corresponding values in the input matrix.
The rank of a value in the output matrix is determined by comparing it with other values in the input matrix. If two or more values are equal, they should have the same rank, which is the maximum rank among them.
The rank of a value in the output matrix should be one more than the maximum rank of any value that is smaller than it in the input matrix.
The rank of a value in the output matrix should be one less than the minimum rank of any value that is larger than it in the input matrix.
If there are multiple values with the same rank in the input matrix, their corresponding values in the output matrix should also have the same rank.
The output matrix should be sorted in non-decreasing order of ranks, both row-wise and column-wise.
