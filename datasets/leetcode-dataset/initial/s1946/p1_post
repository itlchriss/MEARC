The method returns a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating a single substring of `num`.
If no mutation is performed, the method returns `num` itself.
The mutated substring must be contiguous and cannot be empty.
The mutated substring must consist of consecutive digits in `num`.
The mutated substring can be replaced with any other substring of the same length.
The mutated substring can only be replaced with a substring that results in a larger integer.
The mutated substring can only be replaced with a substring that has a higher value in the corresponding index of the `change` array.
The method does not modify the original `num` string or the `change` array.
