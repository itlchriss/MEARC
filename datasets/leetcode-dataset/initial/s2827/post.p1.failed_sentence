The input range of integers, specified by the parameters "low", "high", and "k", should be able to be received by the system.The calculation of the number of beautiful integers within the given range should be performed by the system.The calculated number of beautiful integers should be returned by the system.The lower and upper bounds of the range, inclusive, should be handled by the system.All integers within the range, including negative numbers, should be considered by the system for the method public int numberOfBeautifulIntegers(int low, int high, int k).The condition should be handled by the system when the value of the lower bound parameter is greater than the value of the upper bound parameter.The case where the lower and upper bounds are the same number should be handled by the system.The case where the range includes only one integer should be handled by the system.The case where the range includes no integers should be handled by the system.The range of integers, which includes both positive and negative numbers, should be handled by the system.The range that includes only positive integers should be handled by the system.The range that includes only negative integers should be handled by the system.The case where the range includes zero should be handled by the system.The range of integers from the parameter "low" to the parameter "high" should be efficiently handled by the system.The method should handle scenarios where the range from the low parameter to the high parameter includes values that are not integers.The method should handle scenarios in which the range, which is determined by the parameters low and high, includes decimal values.The range that includes fractions should be handled by the system.The method should handle scenarios in which the range, which includes irrational numbers, is provided as the parameter.The range that includes complex numbers should be handled by the system.The method should handle scenarios where the range of integers, specified by the parameters low and high, includes infinity or negative infinity.
