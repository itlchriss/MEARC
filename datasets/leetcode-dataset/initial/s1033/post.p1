The method `numMovesStones` should take three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`.
The method should return an integer array `answer` of length The method should calculate the minimum and maximum number of moves required to move the stones from their initial positions to a final position.
The stones are initially placed at positions `a`, `b`, and `c`.
The final position of the stones should be such that they are consecutive.
The stones can be moved in any order.
The minimum number of moves is the minimum number of moves required to move the stones to consecutive positions.
The maximum number of moves is the maximum number of moves required to move the stones to consecutive positions.
The method should consider all possible combinations of moving the stones to consecutive positions.
The method should return the minimum and maximum number of moves as elements of the integer array `answer`.
