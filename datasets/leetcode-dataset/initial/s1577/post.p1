In order for the triplets to be considered valid, they must consist of one element from the array `nums1` and two elements from the array `nums2`. The type 1 triplets are valid only if the condition `nums1[i] < nums2[j]` is satisfied for all values of `i` and `j`, where `0 <= i < len(nums1)` and `0 <= j < len(nums2)`. Conversely, the type 2 triplets are valid only if the condition `nums1[i] > nums2[j]` holds true for all values of `i` and `j`, where `0 <= i < len(nums1)` and `0 <= j < len(nums2)`. The desired output is the total number of triplets that meet these conditions.In sentence 1, the triplets are referred to by the pronouns "str_they". 
In sentence 2, the condition `nums1[i] < nums2[j]` is referred to by the pronoun "it". 
In sentence 3, the condition `nums1[i] > nums2[j]` is referred to by the pronoun "it". 
In sentence 4, the total number of triplets is referred to by the pronoun "the".
