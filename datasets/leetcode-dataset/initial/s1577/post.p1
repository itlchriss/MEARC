Preconditions:
The arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must not be null.
The arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must have at least 3 elements each.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the number of triplets formed.
The returned value should be greater than or equal to 
Additional Behavioural Requirements for the method `numTriplets`:
The method should consider both type 1 and type 2 triplets.
Type 1 triplets are formed by selecting one element from `nums1` and two elements from `nums2`.
Type 2 triplets are formed by selecting one element from `nums2` and two elements from `nums1`.
The method should count all possible combinations of triplets.
The order of elements within a triplet does not matter.
The method should not modify the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

Additional Behavioural Requirements for the method `count`:
The method should return an integer value representing the count of elements in array `a` that are present in array `b`.
The returned value should be greater than or equal to The method should not modify the input arrays `a` and `b`.
