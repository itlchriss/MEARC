The method should return an integer value representing the length of the longest substring containing the same letter.
The method should perform the necessary operations to find the longest substring.
The method should consider the value of "k" to determine the maximum number of replacements allowed.
The method should handle cases where the input string has only one unique letter and "k" is greater than or equal to the length of the string.
The method should handle cases where the input string has multiple unique letters and "k" is greater than or equal to the length of the string.
The method should handle cases where the input string has multiple unique letters and "k" is less than the length of the string.
The method should handle cases where the input string has multiple unique letters and "k" is less than the length of the string, but there is no possible substring with the same letter after performing the allowed replacements.
