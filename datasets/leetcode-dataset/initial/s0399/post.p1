Preconditions:
- The method takes in three parameters: equations (a list of lists of strings), values (an array of doubles), and queries (a list of lists of strings).
- The equations parameter represents a set of equations, where each equation is represented as a list of two strings.
- The values parameter represents the values corresponding to each equation in the equations parameter.
- The queries parameter represents a set of queries, where each query is represented as a list of two strings.
- The equations and queries parameters may contain duplicate equations or queries.
- The equations and queries parameters may contain equations or queries that are not solvable.
- The equations and queries parameters may contain equations or queries that have not been defined in the equations parameter.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an array of doubles, representing the answers to all queries.
- If a single answer cannot be determined for a query, the method returns -1.0 for that query.
- The order of the answers in the returned array corresponds to the order of the queries in the queries parameter.
- The returned array has the same length as the queries parameter.
- The returned array may contain -1.0 values for queries that cannot be determined.
- The returned array may contain NaN values for queries that have not been defined in the equations parameter.
