The method takes in three parameters: equations (a list of lists of strings), values (an array of doubles), and queries (a list of lists of strings).
The equations parameter represents a set of equations, where each equation is represented as a list of two strings.
The values parameter represents the values corresponding to each equation in the equations parameter.
The queries parameter represents a set of queries, where each query is represented as a list of two strings.
The equations and queries parameters may contain duplicate equations or queries.
The equations and queries parameters may contain equations or queries that are not solvable.
The equations and queries parameters may contain equations or queries that have not been defined in the equations parameter.
