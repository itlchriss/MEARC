The method should return an array of integers.
The length of the returned array should be equal to the length of the `code` array.
The elements of the returned array should be the decrypted values of the `code` array.
The decryption should be done by subtracting the `k` value from each element of the `code` array.
If the subtraction results in a negative value, it should be wrapped around to the maximum value of an integer.
The first element of the `code` array should be decrypted using the `k` value.
The subsequent elements of the `code` array should be decrypted using the previous decrypted value and the `k` value.
