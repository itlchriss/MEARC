Preconditions:
The method should take a TreeNode object as input representing the root node of a binary tree.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the number of pseudo-palindromic paths from the root node to leaf nodes.
The method should consider a path as pseudo-palindromic if it can be rearranged to form a palindrome.
The method should only consider paths from the root node to leaf nodes, i.e., paths that do not have any child nodes.
The method should traverse the binary tree to find all possible paths from the root node to leaf nodes.
The method should check each path to determine if it is pseudo-palindromic.
The method should increment a counter for each pseudo-palindromic path found.
The method should return the final count of pseudo-palindromic paths.
