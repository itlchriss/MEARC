Preconditions:
The input parameter 'n' must be a positive integer representing the total number of nodes in the network.
The input parameter 'requests' must be a 2D array of integers representing the requests made by different nodes in the network.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the maximum number of achievable requests.
The returned value should be non-negative.
The method should handle the case when no requests are made and return The method should handle the case when there are no nodes in the network and return The method should handle the case when there are no achievable requests and return The method should handle the case when there is only one node in the network and return 0, as there can be no requests in this case.
The method should handle the case when there are multiple nodes in the network and there are achievable requests.
The method should handle the case when there are multiple nodes in the network and there are no achievable requests.
The method should handle the case when there are multiple nodes in the network and all nodes make requests, returning the maximum number of achievable requests.
The method should handle the case when there are multiple nodes in the network and only some nodes make requests, returning the maximum number of achievable requests.
