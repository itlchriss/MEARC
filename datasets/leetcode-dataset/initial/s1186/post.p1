The input array of integers should be accepted by the system, and within this array, all possible subarrays should be identified by the system.Upon identification of the subarrays, the sum of each subarray should be calculated.After performing the necessary calculations, the system should determine the subarray with the highest sum and provide the option to remove one element from this identified subarray.The subarray after deletion must have at least one element remaining, as ensured by the system.After the deletion of elements from the subarray, the sum of the remaining elements should be calculated by the system, and the maximum possible sum of these remaining elements should be determined.The maximum sum of the remaining elements in the subarray should ultimately be returned by the system.
