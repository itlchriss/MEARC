The method `countTexts` takes a string `pressedKeys` as input, which represents the string received by Bob. Bob uses this string to calculate the total number of possible text messages that Alice could have sent. The answer is returned by taking the modulo of 10^9 + 7. In this specific case, there are 8 possible messages, so the answer is 8. To calculate the modulo, Bob uses the formula 2082876103 % (10^9 + 7), which equals 82876089.
