Given a string `pressedKeys` representing the string received by Bob, return _the **total number of possible text messages** Alice could have sent_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>. Since there are 8 possible messages, we return 8. Since we need to return the answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7, we return 2082876103 % (10<sup>9</sup> + 7) = 82876089.
