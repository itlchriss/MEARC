Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `v` for which there exist **different** nodes `a` and `b` where `v = |a.val - b.val|` and `a` is an ancestor of `b`.
**Explanation:** We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
=======
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5000].
