Preconditions:
The input array `num` must not be null.
The input array `num` must not be empty.
The input integer `k` must be non-negative.

Postconditions:
The method should return a list of integers representing the array-form of the sum of `num` and `k`.
The length of the returned list should be equal to the length of the longer input array between `num` and the array-form of `k`.
The elements in the returned list should be non-negative integers.
If the sum of `num` and `k` results in a carry, the carry should be properly propagated to the higher digits in the returned list.
If the sum of `num` and `k` results in a carry at the most significant digit, an additional digit should be added to the leftmost position in the returned list to accommodate the carry.
