The input for the system should strictly be an array of digit strings, where the array is taken as a parameter.The target should be taken by the system as a digit string.The number of pairs of indices, where the concatenation of the elements at indices i and j in the parameter array nums equals the target, should be returned by the system.Pairs where the value of i is equal to the value of j should not be considered by the system.The method should consider all possible combinations of indices i and j, where the parameter array nums is used and the target string is involved.The concatenation of the elements in the array nums[i] and nums[j] should only be considered by the system if it is equal to the target.The method should calculate the count of pairs that meet the condition where the parameter array, nums, is sorted in ascending order and the target is not null.The count of pairs should be returned by the system as the output.
