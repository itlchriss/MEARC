The minimum number of operations needed to convert `x` into `goal` should be calculated by the system.The array of integers, nums, is sorted in ascending order, and the values of start and goal are not null.The system is referred to as "str_It", and the variable "x" is used in this context.The nums array is not null. 
The start and goal parameters are sorted in ascending order.It is possible for the system to determine if it is not possible to convert the array of integers `nums` into the integer `goal` by performing a minimum number of operations, given that the integer `start` is the initial value.In the method public int minimumOperations(int[] nums, int start, int goal), the parameter array, represented by "nums", is expected to be sorted in ascending order. Additionally, the parameter "start" refers to the initial value, while the parameter "goal" represents the desired value.The system is referred to by "str_It", and "x" and "goal" are variables. The variables "nums", "start", and "goal" are used as parameters in the method public int minimumOperations.The nums array is not null. 
The start and goal parameters are sorted in ascending order.The output should be the minimum number of operations, which the system should return, for the method public int minimumOperations(int[] nums, int start, int goal), where the parameter array nums is used and the parameters start and goal are involved.The system strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples, where the pronoun "it" refers to the parameter array. The parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The nums array is not null. 
The start and goal parameters are sorted in ascending order.If it is not possible to convert the value of `start` into the value of `goal`, the system should return -1.In the method public int minimumOperations(int[] nums, int start, int goal), the parameter array, represented by "nums", is expected to be sorted in ascending order. Additionally, the parameter "start" refers to the initial value, while the parameter "goal" represents the desired value.The system is referred to by "str_It", and "x" and "goal" are variables. The variables "nums", "start", and "goal" are used as parameters in the method public int minimumOperations.
