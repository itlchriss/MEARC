You are given an array `richer` where <code>richer[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> has more money than <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> and an integer array `quiet` where `quiet[i]` is the quietness of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person. All the given data in richer are **logically correct** (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where `x` is richer than `y` and `y` is richer than `x` at the same time).
