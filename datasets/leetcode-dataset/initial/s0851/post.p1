The output should be an integer array, where the array represents the result of the method public int[] loudAndRich(int[][] richer, int[] quiet).The array representing the output should have each element representing the individual who is the least quiet among all those who have equal to or more money than the corresponding person in the input array.The value of each element in the output array should indicate the index of the person who is the least quiet, given that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order and the result is not null.The reliance on the smallest value of the str_quiet array for a specific individual is crucial in determining the least quiet person.The individuals who should be compared to identify the least quiet person are only those who have equal to or more money than the person being compared, as the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The array representing the amount of money possessed by each person is the input array.The str_quiet array represents the quietness level of each person.
