Preconditions:
- The input parameter `richer` is a 2D array of integers representing the richer relationships between people.
- The input parameter `quiet` is an array of integers representing the quietness levels of each person.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer array `answer`.
- The length of `answer` is equal to the number of people.
