The method returns a TreeNode object representing the root of the constructed binary tree.
The binary tree constructed has the same structure as the binary tree represented by the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays.
The left subtree of the root node contains elements from the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays that are on the left side of the root node in the inorder traversal.
The right subtree of the root node contains elements from the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays that are on the right side of the root node in the inorder traversal.
The left and right subtrees are constructed recursively using the remaining elements in the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays.
The method handles the case when the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays do not represent a valid binary tree by returning null.
