Preconditions:
The `preorder` array is not null.
The `inorder` array is not null.
The lengths of `preorder` and `inorder` arrays are equal.
The `preorder` array contains unique elements.
The `inorder` array contains unique elements.
The `preorder` array represents the preorder traversal of a binary tree.
The `inorder` array represents the inorder traversal of the same binary tree.

Postconditions:
The method returns a TreeNode object representing the root of the constructed binary tree.
The binary tree constructed has the same structure as the binary tree represented by the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays.
The left subtree of the root node contains elements from the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays that are on the left side of the root node in the inorder traversal.
The right subtree of the root node contains elements from the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays that are on the right side of the root node in the inorder traversal.
The left and right subtrees are constructed recursively using the remaining elements in the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays.
The method handles the case when the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays do not represent a valid binary tree by returning null.
