The script named "str_prepare.sh" needs to be run initially for the system to have the expected result.The script named str_run . sh that needs to be executed should be present in the system.A method named "str_get" should be present in the system, which requires an integer parameter called "index". This method should strictly follow the syntax of the examples provided, where the result is not null and the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The value of the node at the specified index in the linked list should be returned by the str_get method.In the case of an invalid index being provided, the expected behavior is for the str_get method to return -The system should have a linked list named "myLinkedList".The method public MyLinkedList() should be invoked to create the "myLinkedList" object. Then, the method public int get(int index) should be called on the "myLinkedList" object with the parameter 1. This method should return the value 3.
