Preconditions and postconditions for the given methods:

public MyLinkedList():
   - Preconditions: None
   - Postconditions: Creates an empty linked list.

public int get(int index):
   - Preconditions: The linked list is not empty.
   - Postconditions: Returns the value of the node at the specified index. If the index is invalid, returns -
public void addAtHead(int val):
   - Preconditions: None
   - Postconditions: Adds a new node with the given value at the head of the linked list.

public void addAtTail(int val):
   - Preconditions: None
   - Postconditions: Adds a new node with the given value at the tail of the linked list.

public void addAtIndex(int index, int val):
   - Preconditions: The index is within the valid range (0 to size of the linked list).
   - Postconditions: Adds a new node with the given value at the specified index. If the index is invalid, the linked list remains unchanged.
