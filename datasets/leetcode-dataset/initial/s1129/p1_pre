The input parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
The input parameter `redEdges` is a 2D array representing the red edges in the graph. Each element in `redEdges` is an array of size 2, where the first element is the starting node of the edge and the second element is the ending node of the edge.
The input parameter `blueEdges` is a 2D array representing the blue edges in the graph. Each element in `blueEdges` is an array of size 2, where the first element is the starting node of the edge and the second element is the ending node of the edge.
