Preconditions:
- The input parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
- The input parameter `redEdges` is a 2D array representing the red edges in the graph. Each element in `redEdges` is an array of size 2, where the first element is the starting node of the edge and the second element is the ending node of the edge.
- The input parameter `blueEdges` is a 2D array representing the blue edges in the graph. Each element in `blueEdges` is an array of size 2, where the first element is the starting node of the edge and the second element is the ending node of the edge.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an array `answer` of length `n`.
- Each element `answer[x]` in the `answer` array represents the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edge colors alternate along the path.
- If there is no path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edge colors alternate along the path, the value of `answer[x]` is `-1`.
