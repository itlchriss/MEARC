The method returns an array `answer` of length `n`.
Each element `answer[x]` in the `answer` array represents the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edge colors alternate along the path.
If there is no path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edge colors alternate along the path, the value of `answer[x]` is `-1`.
