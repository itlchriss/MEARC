The method should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations.
If it is possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations, the method should return `true`.
If it is not possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations, the method should return `false`.
