The input for the function should consist of four integers, namely `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`. These integers should be taken as input for the function.The expected outcome is a boolean value, which can only be either `true` or `false`.Examining the possibility of converting the point `(sx ,  sy)` to the point `(tx ,  ty)` through operations, the determination of whether the function can achieve this conversion is required.The boolean value `true` should be returned by the function if it is possible to convert the point, and the boolean value `false` should be returned if it is not possible.
