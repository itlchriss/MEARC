Preconditions:
The method should take four integer parameters `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`.
The values of `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty` should be within the range of integer values.
The values of `sx` and `sy` should be non-negative.
The values of `tx` and `ty` should be non-negative.

Postconditions:
The method should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations.
If it is possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations, the method should return `true`.
If it is not possible to convert the point `(sx, sy)` to the point `(tx, ty)` through some operations, the method should return `false`.
