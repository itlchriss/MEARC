The value of 'n' must be a positive integer representing the total number of vertices in the graph.
The 'edges' list must not be null and should contain valid edges between vertices.
Each edge in the 'edges' list must be represented as a list of two integers, where the first integer represents the source vertex and the second integer represents the destination vertex.
The vertices in the 'edges' list must be within the range of 0 to (n-1), inclusive.
