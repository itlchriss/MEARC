The method should return a list of integers representing the smallest set of vertices that can reach all other vertices in the graph.
The returned list should not contain any duplicate vertices.
The order of vertices in the returned list can be arbitrary.
The returned list should only contain vertices that have no incoming edges.
The returned list should include all vertices that have no incoming edges, even if they have outgoing edges.
The returned list should not include any vertices that have incoming edges, even if they have no outgoing edges.
The returned list should include all vertices that have no incoming edges and no outgoing edges.
The returned list should not include any vertices that have both incoming and outgoing edges.
The returned list should not include any vertices that have only outgoing edges.
The returned list should not include any vertices that have only incoming edges.
The returned list should not include any vertices that have both incoming and outgoing edges, but can be reached from other vertices in the graph.
The returned list should not include any vertices that have both incoming and outgoing edges, but can reach other vertices in the graph.
The returned list should not include any vertices that have both incoming and outgoing edges, but can be reached from other vertices and can reach other vertices in the graph.
