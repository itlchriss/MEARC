The head of a linked list should be taken as input by the function, along with an integer value.The linked list should have all nodes removed that possess a value equal to the integer value provided.The head of the modified linked list, after removing all nodes with the value equal to val, should be returned by the function.If the value of the given integer is equal to the value of the head of the linked list, the head should be removed and the next node should become the new head.When there are multiple nodes with the given integer value, it is necessary to remove all of them from the linked list.In the case where there are no nodes containing the specified integer value, the original head of the linked list should be returned by the function.The order of the nodes in the modified linked list, excluding the removed nodes, should be the same as the original linked list.The linked list modifications should be made in-place, without the creation of a new linked list, when the function is called with the parameters of a ListNode head and an integer value val.Finally, in the case of empty linked lists, the null_value should be returned as the new head in order to handle them.
