The method should return the new head of the linked list after removing all nodes with `Node.val == val`.
The order of the remaining nodes in the linked list should be maintained.
If the linked list is empty after removing all nodes with `Node.val == val`, the method should return null.
The original linked list should remain unchanged.
The method should handle cases where multiple nodes have the same value as `val`.
The method should handle cases where the linked list contains only one node with `Node.val == val`.
The method should handle cases where the linked list contains no nodes with `Node.val == val`.
