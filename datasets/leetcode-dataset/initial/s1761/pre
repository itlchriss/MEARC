You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an undirected edge between <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.
