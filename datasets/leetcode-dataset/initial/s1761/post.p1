Preconditions:
The method should take two parameters: an integer n representing the number of nodes in the graph, and a 2D array edges representing the edges between nodes.
The value of n should be greater than or equal to 3, as a trio requires at least 3 nodes to be connected.
The edges array should be non-null and contain at least one element.
The edges array should only contain valid node indices, i.e., indices ranging from 0 to n-The edges array should not contain duplicate edges, as duplicate edges would not contribute to the degree of a connected trio.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph.
If the graph has no connected trios, the method should return -The returned degree value should be non-negative.
The method should not modify the input parameters or any other external state.
