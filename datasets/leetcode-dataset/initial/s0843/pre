You are given an array of **unique** strings `wordlist` where `wordlist[i]` is `6` letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as `secret`. This function returns an `integer` type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the `secret` word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return `-1` instead.
