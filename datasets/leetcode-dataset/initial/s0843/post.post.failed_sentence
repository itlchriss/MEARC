This function returns an `integer` type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the `secret` word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return `-1` instead. master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist. master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches. master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches. master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches. master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.
