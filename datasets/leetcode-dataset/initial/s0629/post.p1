Preconditions:
- The method takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`.
- `n` represents the range of numbers from 1 to n.
- `k` represents the number of inverse pairs.
- `n` and `k` are non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned value represents the number of different arrays consisting of numbers from 1 to n that have exactly k inverse pairs.
- The returned value is modulo 10^9 + 7.
