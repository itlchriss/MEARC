The method returns an array `answer` of size `m`, where `m` is the length of the `queries` array.
Each element `answer[i]` in the `answer` array represents the height of the tree after performing the `i-th` query.
The tree returns to its initial state after each query, meaning that the tree is restored to its original state before performing the next query.
The height of the tree is calculated after performing each query.
