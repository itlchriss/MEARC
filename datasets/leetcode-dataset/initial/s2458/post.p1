Preconditions:
The method `treeQueries` takes two parameters: `root` of type `TreeNode` and `queries` of type `int[]`.
The `root` parameter represents the root node of a binary tree.
The `queries` parameter represents an array of integers, where each integer represents a query to be performed on the tree.
The tree is initially in a valid state.

Postconditions:
The method returns an array `answer` of size `m`, where `m` is the length of the `queries` array.
Each element `answer[i]` in the `answer` array represents the height of the tree after performing the `i-th` query.
The tree returns to its initial state after each query, meaning that the tree is restored to its original state before performing the next query.
The height of the tree is calculated after performing each query.
