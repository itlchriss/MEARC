Preconditions:
The input values for `hour` and `minutes` should be non-negative integers.
The value of `hour` should be between 0 and 11 (inclusive).
The value of `minutes` should be between 0 and 59 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
The method should return a double value representing the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.
The returned angle should be between 0 and 180 degrees (inclusive).
If the angle formed is exactly 180 degrees, it means the hour and minute hand are pointing in opposite directions.
The returned angle should be rounded to two decimal places.
