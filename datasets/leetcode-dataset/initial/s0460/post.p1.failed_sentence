The initial running of the `prepare.sh` script is required for the system to have a properly functioning LFUCache with a specified capacity.The `run.sh` script, which needs to be executed, should be present in the system.The method `int get(int key)` should be present in the system, which retrieves the value of a given key from the cache.If the key is present in the cache, the value of the key should be returned by the `get` method.If the key is not present in the cache, the `get` method should return - The cache called `lfu` should be available in the system.The `lfu` cache should have the capability to retrieve the value of key 1 and return -1 (not found) when the parameter array is not null.The `lfu` cache should have the capability to retrieve the value of key 3 and should return -1 (not found) when attempting to retrieve the value of key 1 again.The `lfu` cache should have the capability to retrieve the value of key 3 once more and return The `lfu` cache should have the capability to retrieve the value of key 4 and return 4.
