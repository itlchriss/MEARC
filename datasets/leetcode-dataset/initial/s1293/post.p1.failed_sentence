The minimum number of steps required for a person to walk from the upper left corner to the lower right corner should be computed by the system, considering the parameter grid as the grid representing the path and the parameter k as the maximum number of obstacles allowed.The possibility of eliminating obstacles during the walk should be considered by the system.The maximum number of obstacles that a person can eliminate should be restricted to k by the system.If the grid does not contain a walk that satisfies the given conditions, the method should return -1.The grid array should be structured in a way that allows for the shortest number of steps required for a person to complete the walk, while the k parameter should be used to determine the minimum number of obstacles that can be encountered.
