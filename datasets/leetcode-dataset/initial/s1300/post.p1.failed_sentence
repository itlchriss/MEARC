Given an integer array `arr` and a target value `target`, the method `findBestValue` should return an integer value `value`. The returned `value` must satisfy the condition that, when all integers greater than `value` in the array `arr` are replaced with `value`, the sum of the array approaches the target value `target` as closely as possible in terms of absolute difference. If there is a tie, the method should return the minimum integer that satisfies the condition. The method `findBestValue` takes the parameters `arr` (an integer array), `target` (an integer), and returns an integer value. The method `check` is not mentioned in this context. The algorithm should be used to determine the best value that satisfies the given condition.
