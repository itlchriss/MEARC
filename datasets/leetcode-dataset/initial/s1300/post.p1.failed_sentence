The input for the system should be an integer array `arr` that is sorted in ascending order. Additionally, the system should take a target value `target` as input.An integer `value` should be returned as output by the system.The array `arr` must be modified by the system, changing all integers larger than the value `v` to be equal to `v`, ensuring that this modification is applied to the entire array.The sum of the modified array should be calculated by the system, and this calculation should be done by adding up all the elements in the array.The absolute difference between the sum of the modified array and the target value should be calculated by the system. This calculation should be achieved by subtracting the target value from the sum of the modified array and taking the absolute value of the result.The `findBestValue` method should identify the `value` that produces the modified array's sum closest to the target value. This should be achieved by trying out different values and selecting the one that minimizes the absolute difference. The `arr` parameter represents the input array, while the `target` parameter represents the desired target value.In the case of a tie, the system should return the minimum integer as the `value`. This action should be performed by selecting the smallest value among those integers that have the same absolute difference.
