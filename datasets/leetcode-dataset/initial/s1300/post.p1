Preconditions:
The input array `arr` is not null.
The input array `arr` is not empty.
The target value `target` is a valid integer.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value.
The returned integer value is the minimum integer `value` such that changing all integers larger than `value` in the array `arr` to be equal to `value` results in the sum of the array getting as close as possible to the target value `target`.
If there are multiple integers that satisfy the condition in postcondition 2, the method returns the minimum such integer.
