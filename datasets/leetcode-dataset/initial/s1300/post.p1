Preconditions:
The input array `arr` is not null.
The input array `arr` is not empty.
The target value `target` is a valid integer.

Postconditions:
The returned value `value` is an integer.
The returned value `value` is the minimum integer such that changing all integers larger than `value` in the array `arr` to be equal to `value` results in the sum of the array getting as close as possible to the target value `target`.
The sum of the array after changing all integers larger than `value` to be equal to `value` is as close as possible to the target value `target` in terms of absolute difference.
