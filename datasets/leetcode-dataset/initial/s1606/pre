You are given a **strictly increasing** array `arrival` of positive integers, where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> request, and another array `load`, where `load[i]` represents the load of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the **busiest server(s)**. A server is considered **busiest** if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.
