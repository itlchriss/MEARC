The Java method `repeatedCharacter` takes a string `s` as input, which consists only of lowercase English letters. The algorithm implemented in this method aims to find and return the first letter that appears twice in the given string. In this particular case, the letter 'd' should be returned as it is the only letter that appears twice in the string.
