Preconditions:
The `grid` parameter must be a 2-dimensional array of integers.
The `moveCost` parameter must be a 2-dimensional array of integers.
The `grid` parameter must have at least 2 rows and 2 columns.
The `moveCost` parameter must have the same number of rows and columns as the `grid` parameter.
The values in the `grid` parameter must be non-negative integers.
The values in the `moveCost` parameter must be non-negative integers.
The `grid` parameter must have at least one cell with a non-zero value in the first row.
The `grid` parameter must have at least one cell with a non-zero value in the last row.

Postconditions:
The method must return an integer representing the minimum cost of a path.
The returned value must be greater than or equal to zero.
The returned value must be the sum of all values of cells visited plus the sum of costs of all the moves made in the minimum cost path.
The minimum cost path must start from any cell in the first row and end at any cell in the last row.
The minimum cost path must be calculated based on the values in the `grid` parameter and the costs in the `moveCost` parameter.
If there are multiple minimum cost paths, the method can return any of them.
