The method should return a string representing the multiplication of the two complex numbers in the format "a+bi", where 'a' and 'b' are integers or floating-point numbers.
The returned string should be simplified, i.e., if the imaginary part is 0, it should not be included in the string.
The returned string should be in the simplest form, i.e., if both the real and imaginary parts are integers, they should not be represented as floating-point numbers.
The returned string should handle negative numbers correctly, i.e., if the real or imaginary part is negative, it should be represented with a negative sign in the string.
The returned string should handle cases where the real or imaginary part is zero correctly, i.e., if the real part is zero, only the imaginary part should be included in the string, and if the imaginary part is zero, only the real part should be included in the string.
The returned string should handle cases where the real or imaginary part is 1 correctly, i.e., if the real part is 1, it should not be included in the string, and if the imaginary part is 1, it should be represented as "i" without the coefficient.
The returned string should handle cases where both the real and imaginary parts are zero correctly, i.e., it should return "0" as the string representation.
