Preconditions:
The method should take three parameters: an integer k, a 2D array rowC, and a 2D array colC.
The value of k should be a positive integer.
The dimensions of rowC and colC should be the same.
The elements of rowC and colC should be non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
The method should return a 2D array.
If there exists a matrix that satisfies the conditions, the returned matrix should satisfy the conditions.
If no matrix exists that satisfies the conditions, the method should return an empty matrix.
