Preconditions:
The `maxTime` parameter must be a positive integer.
The `edges` parameter must be a non-null 2D array.
The `passingFees` parameter must be a non-null array.
The length of the `passingFees` array must be equal to the number of nodes in the graph represented by the `edges` array.
The values in the `passingFees` array must be non-negative integers.
The values in the `edges` array must be non-negative integers.
The `edges` array must represent a valid graph structure, where each edge connects two nodes and has a non-negative cost.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer representing the minimum cost to complete the journey.
If it is not possible to complete the journey within the given `maxTime`, the method should return -The returned minimum cost should be a non-negative integer.
The returned minimum cost should be the smallest possible cost to complete the journey within the given `maxTime`.
The method should not modify the input parameters `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`.
The method should not have any side effects on the state of the program or external systems.
