The array `nums` and the integer `k` are included in the input. The maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of the array should be returned as the output. The subsequence must satisfy the condition that for any two consecutive integers `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is met. The subsequence must not be empty, meaning it must contain at least one element from the array.The subsequence is referred to by the pronoun "str_it" in sentence 2, and the maximum sum is referred to by the pronoun "it" in sentence 3.
