The algorithm finds the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of the integer array `nums` and the integer `k`. This sum is determined by satisfying the condition `j i <= k` for every two consecutive integers `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i` is less than `j`. The result of the algorithm is an integer value.
