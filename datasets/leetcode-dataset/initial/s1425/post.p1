Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` is not empty.
- The input integer `k` is greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of the input array `nums`.
- The subsequence satisfies the condition `j - i <= k` for every two consecutive integers `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`.
