The Java method `removeTrailingZeros(String num)` takes a positive integer `num` represented as a string as input. It removes any trailing zeros from the integer and returns the resulting integer without any trailing zeros as a string. 

For example, if the input integer is "str_51230100" and it contains 2 trailing zeros, the method removes the zeros and returns the integer "512301" as a string. 

On the other hand, if the input integer is "str_123" and it does not have any trailing zeros, the method simply returns the integer "123" as a string. 

The algorithm used in this method ensures that the resulting string represents the integer without any trailing zeros.
