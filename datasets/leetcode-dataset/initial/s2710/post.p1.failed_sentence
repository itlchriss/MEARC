The parameter num must represent a positive integer as a string with no trailing zeros.The input, which is the parameter num, has no trailing zeros.The integer input must have its trailing zeros removed and be represented as a string, which will serve as the output.The output, referred to as str_it, is not null when the input integer, referred to as the parameter num, has its trailing zeros removed.If the parameter string num has trailing zeros, they must be removed.The trailing zeros, which the parameter num refers to, are removed.If the parameter string num has no trailing zeros, it must be returned as is.The input integer, which is referred to as str_it, does not have any trailing zeros.The integer passed as the parameter can contain any number of digits.The num parameter contains a string, and the trailing zeros are removed.The integer output should not contain any leading zeros when the string parameter "num" is passed.The output integer, referred to as str_it, does not have a null value. The ascending order is applied to the parameter array.The integers representing the input and output must be represented as strings.The num parameter contains a string, and the trailing zeros are removed.
