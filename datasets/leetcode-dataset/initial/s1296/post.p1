Postconditions:
The method should return `true` if it is possible to divide all elements of the array `nums` into groups of size `k`.
The method should return `false` if it is not possible to divide all elements of the array `nums` into groups of size `k`.
The method should return `false` if the number of elements in the array `nums` is not divisible by `k`.
The method should return `false` if there are any duplicate elements in the array `nums`.
The method should return `false` if there are any negative elements in the array `nums`.
The method should return `false` if there are any elements in the array `nums` that are not divisible by `k`.
The method should return `true` if all elements in the array `nums` can be divided into groups of size `k` without any remainder.
