The method returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
If there is a way to arrange the elements of `arr` such that the sum of any two adjacent elements is divisible by `k`, the method returns `true`.
If there is no way to arrange the elements of `arr` such that the sum of any two adjacent elements is divisible by `k`, the method returns `false`.
