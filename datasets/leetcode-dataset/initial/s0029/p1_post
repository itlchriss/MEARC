The method should return an integer value representing the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.
If the quotient is strictly greater than the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer, return the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.
If the quotient is strictly less than the minimum value of a 32-bit signed integer, return the minimum value of a 32-bit signed integer.
