Preconditions:
The method takes three parameters: an integer `n` representing the total number of nodes, a 2D integer array `edges` representing the edges between nodes, and an integer array `restricted` representing the restricted nodes.
The value of `n` is a positive integer.
The length of the `edges` array is greater than or equal to The length of the `restricted` array is greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
The method returns an integer representing the maximum number of nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
The returned value is greater than or equal to The returned value is less than or equal to `n`, the total number of nodes.
The method does not modify the values of the `n`, `edges`, or `restricted` parameters.
The method does not modify the state of any other variables or objects outside its scope.
