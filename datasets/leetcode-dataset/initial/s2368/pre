You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given an integer array `restricted` which represents **restricted** nodes.
