The method takes three parameters: an integer `n` representing the total number of nodes, a 2D integer array `edges` representing the edges between nodes, and an integer array `restricted` representing the restricted nodes.
The value of `n` is a positive integer.
The length of the `edges` array is greater than or equal to The length of the `restricted` array is greater than or equal to
