The returned binary tree is not null.
The returned binary tree is a valid binary tree.
The root node of the returned binary tree has the maximum value among all elements in the input array `nums`.
The left subtree of the root node of the returned binary tree is constructed from the elements in the input array `nums` that are to the left of the maximum value.
The right subtree of the root node of the returned binary tree is constructed from the elements in the input array `nums` that are to the right of the maximum value.
The left subtree and right subtree of the root node of the returned binary tree are also maximum binary trees constructed recursively using the same method.
