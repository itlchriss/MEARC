To ensure proper initialization of the system, the `prepare.sh` script must be executed.After executing the `prepare . sh` script, the `run . sh` script must be run by the system.To fetch the value linked to the given key, the method `int get(int key)` should be present in the system.If the specified key does not have a corresponding mapping in the map, the `get(int key)` method should return a result that is not null. Within the system, there should exist an object called `myHashMap` which is an instance of the class MyHashMap.After invoking the `get(int key)` method with the key 1, a value should be returned. Additionally, the map should be updated to include the key-value pairs [[1, 1], [2, 2]].After invoking the `get(int key)` method with the key 3, the expected result is that it should return - and the map should remain unchanged as [[1, 1], [2, 2]].After the `get(int key)` method is invoked with the key 2, the expected outcome is that it will return a value. Additionally, the map should be updated to [[1, 1], [2, 1]].After invoking the `get(int key)` method with the key 2, the expected result is that it should return - and after calling the `get(int key)` method again with the key 2, the expected outcome is that the map should remain as [[1, 1]].
