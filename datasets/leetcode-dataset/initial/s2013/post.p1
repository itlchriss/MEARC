When the argument [11, 10] is passed to the count method of the DetectSquares class, the result is 1. This indicates that there is one square in the data structure that can be formed with the query point [11, 10]. On the other hand, when the argument [14, 8] is passed to the count method, the result is 0. This is because the query point [14, 8] is unable to form a square with any of the points in the data structure. 

In the case of the argument [11, 10], the count method returns a count of 2. This means that there are two possible squares that can be formed with the query point [11, 10]. The reader has the option to choose either the first, second, and third points or the first, third, and fourth points to form these squares.
