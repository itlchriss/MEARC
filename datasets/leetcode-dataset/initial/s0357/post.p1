To solve the problem, we need to find the count of all numbers with unique digits, denoted as `x`, where `x` is an integer between 0 and 10^n. The method should take an integer `n` as a parameter and return the count as an integer.

The algorithm should iterate through all numbers between 0 and 10^n and check if each number has unique digits. If a number has unique digits, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the count of numbers with unique digits.

Note that the algorithm does not mention any specific method or use pronouns.
