The method returns a long value representing the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of `nums`.
The elements of the subsequence used to calculate the maximum alternating sum are reindexed, meaning their original indices in the input array `nums` are not preserved.
The input array `nums` remains unchanged after the method is executed.
