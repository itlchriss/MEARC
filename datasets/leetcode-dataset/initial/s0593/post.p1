Preconditions:
The method should take four arrays of integers as input parameters representing the coordinates of four points in 2D space.
The input arrays should have a length of 2, representing the x and y coordinates of each point.
The input arrays should not be null.
The input arrays should contain valid integer values for the coordinates.

Postconditions:
The method should return a boolean value indicating whether the four points construct a square.
If the four points construct a square, the method should return true.
If the four points do not construct a square, the method should return false.
