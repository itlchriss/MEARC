The array `nums` must be a non-null and non-empty array of integers.
The array `nums` must have a length greater than or equal to The array `nums` must only contain integers.
The quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` must be distinct, meaning that no two quadruplets can have the same values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
The quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` must be selected from the elements of the array `nums`.
The order of the elements in the quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` does not matter, meaning that `(a, b, c, d)` is considered the same as `(b, a, c, d)` or any other permutation of the elements.
The method should return an integer representing the number of distinct quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` that satisfy the given conditions.
