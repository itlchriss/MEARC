The array `nums` must be a non-null and non-empty array of integers.
The array `nums` must have a length of at least The array `nums` must only contain integers.
The quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` must be distinct, meaning that no two quadruplets can have the same values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
The quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` must be selected from the elements of the array `nums`.
The quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` must be selected in such a way that the indices of the elements in the array `nums` are in increasing order. In other words, the indices of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` must satisfy the condition `0 <= a < b < c < d < nums.length`.
The method should return the number of distinct quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` that satisfy the above conditions.
