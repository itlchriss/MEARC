You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has **two** main properties: **attack** and **defense**. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where <code>properties[i] = [attack<sub>i</sub>, defense<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the properties of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> character in the game.
