- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18. We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer. - Integers in the range [1, 5] that are divisible by 6 are [], num2 is the sum of those integers = 0. We return 15 - 0 = 15 as the answer. - Integers in the range [1, 5] that are divisible by 1 are [1,2,3,4,5], num2 is the sum of those integers = 15. We return 0 - 15 = -15 as the answer.
Return _the integer_ `num1 - num2`.
