Preconditions:
The method should take in five parameters: n (the number of alloys), k (the number of elements in each alloy), budget (the available budget), composition (a list of lists representing the composition of each alloy), stock (a list representing the current stock of each element), and cost (a list representing the cost of each element).
The composition list should have n sublists, each containing k integers representing the composition of each alloy.
The stock list should have k integers representing the current stock of each element.
The cost list should have k integers representing the cost of each element.
The budget should be a non-negative integer.
The stock and cost lists should only contain non-negative integers.
The length of the composition, stock, and cost lists should be equal to k.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer representing the maximum number of alloys that the company can create.
The returned value should be a non-negative integer.
The returned value should be less than or equal to n.
The returned value should be based on the available budget, composition of alloys, current stock of elements, and cost of elements.
The method should not modify the composition, stock, or cost lists.
The method should not have any side effects on the system or external resources.
