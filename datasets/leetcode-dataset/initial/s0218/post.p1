Preconditions:
The input parameter "buildings" is a 2D array of integers representing the locations and heights of all the buildings.
The buildings array is not null and has at least one building.
Each building in the array is represented by a subarray of length 3, where the first element is the left edge, the second element is the right edge, and the third element is the height.
The left edge of each building is less than the right edge.
The height of each building is a positive integer.

Postconditions:
The method returns a List of Lists of Integers representing the skyline formed by the buildings collectively.
Each sublist in the returned List represents a horizontal line segment in the skyline.
Each sublist contains two elements: the left coordinate and the right coordinate of the line segment.
The skyline is formed by connecting the top edges of the buildings.
The skyline does not contain any overlapping line segments.
The skyline is sorted in ascending order based on the left coordinate of each line segment.
