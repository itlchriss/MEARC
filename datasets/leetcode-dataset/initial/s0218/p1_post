The method returns a List of Lists of Integers representing the skyline formed by the buildings collectively.
Each sublist in the returned List represents a horizontal line segment in the skyline.
Each sublist contains two elements: the left coordinate and the right coordinate of the line segment.
The skyline is formed by connecting the top edges of the buildings.
The skyline does not contain any overlapping line segments.
The skyline is sorted in ascending order based on the left coordinate of each line segment.
