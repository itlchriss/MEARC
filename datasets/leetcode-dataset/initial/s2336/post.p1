 The function `int popSmallest()` in the initial prepare . sh run . sh removes and returns the smallest integer from the infinite set. The code `smallestInfiniteSet . popSmallest()` is used to call the function and retrieve the smallest number from the set. 
When the `popSmallest()` function is called, it would return the smallest integer, removing it from the set as well. 
When the `popSmallest()` function is called again, it would return the next smallest integer and remove it from the set in the same way. 
This process continues with subsequent calls to the `popSmallest()` function. 

In this context, "it" refers to the smallest integer returned by the `popSmallest()` function.
