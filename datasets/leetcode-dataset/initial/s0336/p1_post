The method returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a pair of distinct indices `(i, j)` from the input list.
The concatenation of the words at indices `i` and `j` in the input list is a palindrome for each pair in the returned list.
The returned list does not contain any duplicate pairs.
The returned list is sorted in ascending order based on the indices `(i, j)` of the pairs.
