The `pick` method in the `Solution` class randomly selects an index `i` from the `nums` array. This index is chosen in a way that ensures `nums[i]` is equal to the target value. If there are multiple valid indices, each index has an equal probability of being returned. For example, when `pick(3)` is called, the method should randomly return index 2, 3, or 4. It is important to note that each index has an equal chance of being returned. Similarly, when `pick(1)` is called, the method should return 0 because only `nums[0]` is equal to 1.
