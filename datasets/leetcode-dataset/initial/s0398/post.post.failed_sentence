initial prepare.sh run.sh `int pick(int target)` Picks a random index `i` from `nums` where `nums[i] == target`. If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning. solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning. solution.pick(1); // It should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1. solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
