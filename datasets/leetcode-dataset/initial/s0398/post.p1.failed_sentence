To ensure the program's correct functionality, an integer `target` should be accepted as input by a function named `pick`. This function should be included in the program.The integer returned by the `pick` function represents an index `i` that is randomly selected from the array `nums`. This index `i` is selected under the condition that the value at `nums[i]` is equal to the `target` parameter.If there exist multiple valid indices `i` where the value of `nums[i]` is equal to the target value, the `pick` function should randomly select one of these indices with an equal probability.The function `initial` should be included in the program to ensure the proper functioning of the `pick` function by preparing the necessary data structures or variables.To ensure the successful execution of the `initial` function, the program must supply a script named `prepare.sh`.The script named `run.sh` should be included in the program. This script will execute the `pick` function using the given inputs.When the `pick` function is invoked with a target value of 1, and the only valid index is 0, the program should produce the correct index.When the `pick` function is called with a target value of 3, and the valid indices are 2, 3, or 4, the program should randomly return one of these indices. Each index should have an equal probability of being returned.
