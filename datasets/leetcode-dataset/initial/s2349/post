nc.find(10); // There is no index that is filled with number 10. Therefore, we return -1. nc.find(10); // Number 10 is at the indices 1, 2, 3, and 5. Since the smallest index that is filled with 10 is 1, we return 1. nc.find(10); // Number 10 is at the indices 2, 3, and 5. The smallest index that is filled with 10 is 2. Therefore, we return 2.
initial prepare.sh run.sh **Return** the smallest index for the given number in the system. initial prepare.sh run.sh `int find(int number)` Returns the smallest index for the given `number`, or `-1` if there is no index that is filled by `number` in the system.
