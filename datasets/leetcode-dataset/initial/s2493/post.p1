Preconditions:
- The method takes two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, and a 2D integer array `edges` representing the connections between nodes.
- The value of `n` should be a positive integer.
- The length of the `edges` array should be greater than or equal to - Each element in the `edges` array should be an array of length 2, representing a connection between two nodes.
- The values in the `edges` array should be valid node indices, i.e., between 0 and `n-1`.
- There should be no duplicate connections in the `edges` array.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the maximum number of groups (`m`) into which the nodes can be divided.
- If it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions, the method returns -1.
