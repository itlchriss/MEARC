The method should return an integer value representing the number of distinct subsequences of `text` that equals `text2`.
If there are no distinct subsequences of `text` that equals `text2`, the method should return The method should handle both uppercase and lowercase characters in `text` and `text2`.
The method should consider the order of characters in `text` and `text2` while counting distinct subsequences.
The method should not consider any characters in `text` that are not present in `text2` while counting distinct subsequences.
The method should not consider any duplicate characters in `text` while counting distinct subsequences.
The method should not consider any duplicate characters in `text2` while counting distinct subsequences.
The method should handle cases where `text` and `text2` have different lengths.
The method should handle cases where `text` is longer than `text2`.
The method should handle cases where `text2` is longer than `text`.
The method should handle cases where `text` and `text2` have the same characters but in different orders.
The method should handle cases where `text` and `text2` have the same characters in the same order.
The method should handle cases where `text` and `text2` have no common characters.
The method should handle cases where `text` and `text2` have all common characters but in different frequencies.
The method should handle cases where `text` and `text2` have all common characters in the same frequencies.
