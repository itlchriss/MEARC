Preconditions and postconditions for the given methods can be extracted as follows:

public LruCacheNode(int k, int v):
   - Preconditions:
     - The method should be called with valid integer values for k and v.
   - Postconditions:
     - A new LruCacheNode object is created with the provided key (k) and value (v).

public LRUCache(int cap):
   - Preconditions:
     - The method should be called with a valid integer value for cap.
   - Postconditions:
     - A new LRUCache object is created with the provided capacity (cap).

public int get(int key):
   - Preconditions:
     - The method should be called on an existing LRUCache object.
     - The key parameter should be a valid integer value.
   - Postconditions:
     - If the key exists in the LRUCache, the method returns the corresponding value.
     - If the key does not exist in the LRUCache, the method returns -
public void put(int key, int value):
   - Preconditions:
     - The method should be called on an existing LRUCache object.
     - The key and value parameters should be valid integer values.
   - Postconditions:
     - If the key already exists in the LRUCache, the corresponding value is updated.
     - If the key does not exist in the LRUCache and the cache is at its capacity, the least recently used item is evicted before adding the new key-value pair.
     - If the key does not exist in the LRUCache and the cache is not at its capacity, the new key-value pair is added to the cache.
