The method should return a long value representing the maximum possible cost.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering all possible root choices in the graph.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by finding the maximum cost among all possible paths from the root to the leaf nodes.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering the cost associated with each node in the path.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering the edges between the nodes in the path.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering the cost associated with each edge in the path.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering the cost associated with each node and edge in the path.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering all possible paths from the root to the leaf nodes in the graph.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering all possible root choices in the graph.
