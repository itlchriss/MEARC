Preconditions:
The method should take in three parameters: an integer n, a 2D integer array edges, and an integer array price.
The integer n represents the number of nodes in the graph.
The 2D integer array edges represents the edges between the nodes in the graph.
The integer array price represents the cost associated with each node.
The length of the integer array price should be equal to n.
The length of the 2D integer array edges should be equal to n-
Postconditions:
The method should return a long value representing the maximum possible cost.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering all possible root choices in the graph.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by finding the maximum cost among all possible paths from the root to the leaf nodes.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering the cost associated with each node in the path.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering the edges between the nodes in the path.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering the cost associated with each edge in the path.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering the cost associated with each node and edge in the path.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering all possible paths from the root to the leaf nodes in the graph.
The maximum possible cost should be calculated by considering all possible root choices in the graph.
