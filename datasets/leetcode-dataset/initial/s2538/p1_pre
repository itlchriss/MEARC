The method should take in three parameters: an integer n, a 2D integer array edges, and an integer array price.
The integer n represents the number of nodes in the graph.
The 2D integer array edges represents the edges between the nodes in the graph.
The integer array price represents the cost associated with each node.
The length of the integer array price should be equal to n.
The length of the 2D integer array edges should be equal to n-
