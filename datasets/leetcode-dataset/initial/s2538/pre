There exists an undirected and initially unrooted tree with `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array `price`, where `price[i]` is the price of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node. The **price sum** of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on that path.
