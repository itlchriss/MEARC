Preconditions:
The `board` parameter must be a valid puzzle board.
The `depth` parameter must be a non-negative integer.
The `y` parameter must be a valid row index in the puzzle board.
The `x` parameter must be a valid column index in the puzzle board.

Postconditions:
The method should return a Node object representing the state of the board after the least number of moves required to solve it.
If it is impossible to solve the board, the method should return `-1`.
The `board` parameter should remain unchanged after the method is executed.
The `depth` parameter should remain unchanged after the method is executed.
The `y` parameter should remain unchanged after the method is executed.
The `x` parameter should remain unchanged after the method is executed.
The `slidingPuzzle` method should not modify any other variables or objects outside its scope.
The `swap` method should return a new string representing the board after swapping the positions of the elements at `(y1, x1)` and `(y2, x2)`.
The `swap` method should not modify the original `board` string.
The `swap` method should not modify any other variables or objects outside its scope.
