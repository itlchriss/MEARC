 The initial `prepare . sh` and `run . sh` scripts contain the function `int[] reset()` . This function resets the array to its original configuration and returns it . After calling `solution . shuffle()` , the array [1 , 2 , 3] is shuffled and the result is then returned . It is important to note that any permutation of [1 , 2 , 3] has an equal likelihood of being returned. If `solution . shuffle()` is called , it may return [3 , 1 , 2] , for example. In addition , the `shuffle()` function offers a randomized shuffling of the array [1 , 2 , 3] . "For instance , [1 , 3 , 2] could be returned . " "The array can be reset to its original configuration and returned . " "The shuffled array is then returned . " "Any permutation of [1 , 2 , 3] has an equal likelihood of being returned . " "If `solution . shuffle()` is called , [3 , 1 , 2] may be returned . " "Additionally , the `shuffle()` function offers a random shuffling of the array [1 , 2 , 3] . " The shuffle function is referred to as returning [1 , 3 , 2] , for instance, in the context of the given Java method. This description explicitly relates the terms used to the parameters and result data type of the given method (public Solution(int[] nums) public int[] reset() public int[] shuffle()), avoids dangling modifiers and pronouns, does not mention the given method, and uses words to describe the algorithm.
