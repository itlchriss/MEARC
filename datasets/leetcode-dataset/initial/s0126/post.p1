Preconditions:
The `beginWord` and `endWord` parameters must not be null.
The `wordList` parameter must not be null or empty.

All words in the `wordList` must be of the same length as `beginWord` and `endWord`.
The `wordList` must contain at least one word that can be transformed into `endWord`.

Postconditions:
The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
If no transformation sequence exists, the method should return an empty list.
Each transformation sequence should start with `beginWord` and end with `endWord`.
Each transformation sequence should contain only valid words from the `wordList`.
Each transformation sequence should be the shortest possible sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
