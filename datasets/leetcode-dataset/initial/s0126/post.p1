As input, the two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, should be taken by the system.Furthermore, the input for the system should consist of a dictionary named `wordList`, which is to be taken as a parameter.To obtain all the shortest transformation sequences from the word "beginWord" to the word "endWord", the list "wordList" should be used. The system is expected to return these sequences.If the wordList does not contain any transformation sequence, the system should return an empty list.For each transformation sequence, the expected outcome is a list of words, where the requirement specifies that it should be returned as a list.The initial term in every sequence of transformations must always be `beginWord`, and it is crucial to emphasize this fact.The last word in each transformation sequence should always be `endWord`, just like the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The transformation sequences should be prioritized by the system to ensure that they are as short as possible, given that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order and the result is not null.By utilizing the words present in the `wordList` dictionary, the transformation sequences should be discovered by the system.The `wordList` dictionary must be the sole consideration for the transformation sequences, ensuring that only valid words are taken into account.The transformation sequences between words should be restricted to one letter changes, and this restriction should be applied by the system.The transformation sequences should only allow single letter changes at a time, and in addition, the system ought to permit this.To ensure that all possibilities are covered, the system should take into account all possible one letter changes for each word in the transformation sequences, considering the parameters beginWord, endWord, and wordList.The `wordList` dictionary should be considered by the system, taking into account all possible one letter changes for each word.To ensure the discovery of transformation sequences, the system must consider all potential one letter changes for each word in the `wordList` dictionary.
