The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
If no transformation sequence exists, the method should return an empty list.
Each transformation sequence should start with `beginWord` and end with `endWord`.
Each transformation sequence should contain only valid words from the `wordList`.
Each transformation sequence should be the shortest possible sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
