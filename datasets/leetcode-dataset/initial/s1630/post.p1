Preconditions:
- The input arrays `nums`, `l`, and `r` must not be null.
- The length of arrays `l` and `r` must be equal.
- The length of arrays `l` and `r` must be less than or equal to the length of array `nums`.
- The values in arrays `l` and `r` must be valid indices within the range of array `nums`.

Postconditions:
- The returned list `answer` must not be null.
- The length of the returned list `answer` must be equal to the length of arrays `l` and `r`.
- The values in the returned list `answer` must be of type boolean.
- The value at index `i` in the returned list `answer` must be `true` if the subarray `nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]` can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence.
- The value at index `i` in the returned list `answer` must be `false` if the subarray `nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]` cannot be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence.
