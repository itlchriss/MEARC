The binary search tree resulting from the method should be balanced.The output binary search tree is referred to as str_it, and it is ensured that it is not null.The node values of the input binary search tree should be the same as the node values of the output binary search tree.The output binary search tree is referred to as str_it, and it is ensured that it is not null.If there exists more than one possible balanced binary search tree, any of those balanced binary search trees can be returned as the output.The array of parameters, which represents a possible balanced binary search tree, is sorted in ascending order.
