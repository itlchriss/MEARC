To achieve a balanced binary search tree with the same node values as the given `root` of a binary search tree, an algorithm should be implemented. This algorithm should take the `root` as a parameter and return a balanced binary search tree as the result. In case there are multiple balanced binary search trees that can be obtained, any of them can be returned.
