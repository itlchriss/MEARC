The input of a string `word` should be allowed by the system for the purpose of the method public int addMinimum, ensuring strict adherence to the syntax of the given examples and explicitly relating the parameters to the terms in it.Validating the input string `word` should be done by the system.To ensure the validity of the input string `word`, the minimum number of letters that need to be inserted should be determined by the system.The user should be allowed by the system to insert the letters "str_a", "b", or "c" into the input string `word`, ensuring that it strictly follows the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." This applies to the method `public int addMinimum(String word)` where the parameters are explicitly related to the terms used.The user should be allowed by the system to insert any number of letters str_a, "b", or "c" into the input string `word`, ensuring that it strictly adheres to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."
