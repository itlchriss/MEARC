To determine the minimum number of letters that need to be inserted in order to make the given string `word` valid, an algorithm is implemented in the Java method `addMinimum(String word)`. The method takes a string `word` as a parameter and returns an integer value. The returned value represents the minimum number of letters that need to be inserted in `word` to make it valid.
