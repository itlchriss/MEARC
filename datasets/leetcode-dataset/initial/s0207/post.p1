Preconditions:
The method should take in two parameters: `numCourses` (an integer representing the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a 2D array representing the prerequisites for each course).
The `numCourses` parameter should be a positive integer.
The `prerequisites` parameter should be a non-null 2D array.
The `prerequisites` array should have dimensions `n x 2`, where `n` is the number of prerequisites.
Each prerequisite in the `prerequisites` array should be a valid course number.
The prerequisites should not have any cyclic dependencies.

Postconditions:
The method should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to finish all courses.
If it is possible to finish all courses, the method should return `true`.
If it is not possible to finish all courses, the method should return `false`.
