You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `relations` where <code>relations[i] = [prevCourse<sub>i</sub>, nextCourse<sub>i</sub>]</code>, representing a prerequisite relationship between course <code>prevCourse<sub>i</sub></code> and course <code>nextCourse<sub>i</sub></code>: course <code>prevCourse<sub>i</sub></code> has to be taken before course <code>nextCourse<sub>i</sub></code>. Also, you are given the integer `k`. **Explanation:** The figure above represents the given graph. In the first semester, you can take courses 2 and 3. In the second semester, you can take course 1. In the third semester, you can take course 4. **Explanation:** The figure above represents the given graph. In the first semester, you can take courses 2 and 3 only since you cannot take more than two per semester. In the second semester, you can take course 4. In the third semester, you can take course 1. In the fourth semester, you can take course 5. initial prepare.sh run.sh The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
