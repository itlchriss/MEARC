The method should return an integer representing the final maximized capital.
The returned final maximized capital should be greater than or equal to the initial capital `w`.
The returned final maximized capital should be the maximum possible capital that can be achieved by picking at most `k` distinct projects.
The projects picked to maximize the final capital should be distinct, i.e., no project should be picked more than once.
The projects picked should have a capital less than or equal to the available capital `w` at the start.
The projects picked should have a capital less than or equal to the available capital `w` at any point during the selection process.
The projects picked should have a capital less than or equal to the available capital `w` after each project is selected.
The projects picked should have a capital less than or equal to the available capital `w` after each project is selected and its profit is added to the capital.
The projects picked should have a capital less than or equal to the available capital `w` after each project is selected and its profit is added to the capital, and any previously picked project is discarded if necessary to maintain the maximum number of distinct projects.
The projects picked should have a capital less than or equal to the available capital `w` after each project is selected and its profit is added to the capital, and any previously picked project is discarded if necessary to maintain the maximum number of distinct projects, and the discarded project's profit is subtracted from the capital.
