Preconditions:
- The method should take two integer parameters, `queryRow` and `queryGlass`, representing the row and glass number to query.
- The method should take an integer parameter `poured`, representing the number of cups of champagne poured.
- The method should return a double value representing the fill level of the specified glass.

Postconditions:
- The method should calculate and return the fill level of the specified glass in the specified row after pouring the given number of cups of champagne.
- The fill level should be a decimal value between 0 and 1, representing the proportion of the glass that is filled.
- The fill level should be calculated based on the following rules:
  - The top glass in the pyramid (row 0, glass 0) is initially filled with the given number of cups of champagne.
  - Each glass in the pyramid (except for the top glass) receives half of the overflow from the two glasses directly above it.
  - If a glass receives more champagne than it can hold, the excess champagne overflows equally to the two glasses directly below it.
  - If a glass does not receive any champagne from the glasses above it, its fill level is   - If a glass receives champagne from the glasses above it, its fill level is the sum of the champagne it receives and any overflow from the glasses above it, divided by   - The fill level of the specified glass in the specified row should be calculated based on the above rules.
