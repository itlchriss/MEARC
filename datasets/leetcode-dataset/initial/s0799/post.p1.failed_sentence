The input for the function should be two non-negative integers, i and j, which will handle non-negative integer inputs for them.The amount of champagne in the jth glass in the ith row should be accurately calculated by the function, which should return the result based on the pouring.The inputs for poured, queryRow, and queryGlass should be 0-indexed. Additionally, the method should be able to handle cases where the ith row or the jth glass does not exist.The pouring of non-negative integer cups of champagne should be handled by the function, and the pouring of champagne into multiple glasses in multiple rows should also be handled.The method should be able to handle scenarios where the amount of champagne poured into the glass is greater than its capacity, as well as scenarios where the amount of champagne poured into the glass is less than or equal to its capacity.The method should handle scenarios where the value of the poured parameter is 0 or less, and the values of the queryRow and queryGlass parameters are specified.
