To calculate the number of nice pairs, an algorithm is implemented in a Java method that takes in an integer array `nums` (0-indexed), as well as two integers `low` and `high`. The method returns an integer value. The algorithm involves inserting numbers into a Trie data structure using the `insertNumber` method.
