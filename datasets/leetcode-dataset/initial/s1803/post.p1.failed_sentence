The 0-indexed integer array `nums` is the input.The integers `low` and `high` are included in the input.The count of nice pairs should be the output.A defined nice pair is represented as a pair of indices `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length` and `low <= nums[i] * 2 <= nums[j] <= high`.The output should be the count of nice pairs that are to be returned.
