The string `s` is considered a final string input only if it is the last string in the sequence.The sum of the score of every `s_i` is the output, but only if each `s_i`'s score is determined by its position in the string.The position of each character in the string `s` determines the score of each `s_i`, with the first position having a certain score, the second position having a different score, and so on.The score of the first `s_i` in the string `s` is 1 only when `s_i` is the initial score. The second `s_i` in `s` is 2 only when it follows the first score. The third `s_i` in `s` is 3 only when it follows the second score, and so on.The calculation of the sum of the scores is performed by adding up all the scores of `s_i` only if the score of each `s_i` is included in the calculation.The output is returned as the final result only if the ultimate outcome is the final result.
