There are `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given an array `edges` of size `n-1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a bidirectional edge between cities <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a **tree**.
