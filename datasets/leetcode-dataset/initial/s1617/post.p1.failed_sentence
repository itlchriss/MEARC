The size of the output array should be n-1, and the elements in the output array should be in 1-indexed format, corresponding to the count of subgraphs for each diameter.For each element in the resulting array, it represents the number of subtrees and the maximum distance between any two cities in each subtree should be equal to the corresponding index in the resulting array.The calculation of the maximum distance between any two cities should be based on the number of edges between them. The total number of cities in the tree is represented by the input value n.
