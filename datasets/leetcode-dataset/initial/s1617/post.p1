Preconditions:
The input parameter `n` must be a positive integer.
The input parameter `edges` must be a non-null 2D array.
The number of rows in the `edges` array must be equal to `n-1`.
Each row in the `edges` array must contain exactly 2 elements.
The elements in each row of the `edges` array must be integers.
The integers in the `edges` array must be within the range of 1 to `n`.
The `edges` array must represent a valid tree structure with `n` nodes.

Postconditions:
The returned array must be of size `n-1`.
Each element in the returned array must be an integer.
The elements in the returned array must be in the same order as the distances they represent.
The maximum distance between any two cities in each subtree must be equal to the corresponding distance represented by the element in the returned array.
The returned array must be 1-indexed, i.e., the first element in the array represents a distance of 1, the second element represents a distance of 2, and so on.
The sum of all elements in the returned array must be equal to the total number of subtrees in the tree structure represented by the `edges` array.
