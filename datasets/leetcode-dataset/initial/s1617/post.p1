The algorithm should output an array of size n-1, where each element at index d (1-indexed) represents the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to d. The input for this algorithm is an integer n representing the number of cities, and a 2D array edges representing the connections between cities. The algorithm should return an integer array as the result.
