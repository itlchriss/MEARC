In the case where there is no path available, the expected return value of the system should be `[0, 0]`.The list of two integers should be returned by the system, strictly adhering to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order.", without using any dangling modifier or pronouns. This list should clearly apply to the method public int[] pathsWithMaxScore(List<String> board) by explicitly relating the parameter board to the terms in it.The maximum sum of numeric characters that can be collected should be represented by the first integer in the list.The number of paths that can be taken to achieve the maximum sum should be represented by the second integer in the list.The modulo operation should be applied to the second integer, using `10^9 + 7` as the divisor.
