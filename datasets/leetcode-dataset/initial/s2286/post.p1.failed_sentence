The function `gather` should be present in the system and it should accept two parameters: `k`, which represents the number of group members, and `maxRow`, which represents the maximum row number.The array length that the `gather` function should return denotes the row and seat number of the first seat being allocated to the group members.The seating arrangement of the group must ensure that all group members sit together.The allocation of seats should be consecutive, indicating that the `gather` function should be utilized to determine the smallest possible row and seat number where all seats for the group members are both valid and empty. The row number must not exceed `maxRow`. In the event that it is not feasible to assign seats to the group, the `gather` function should return an empty array. The system should include a function called `scatter` with two parameters: `k` representing the number of group members, and `maxRow` representing the maximum row number. The `scatter` function should return a boolean value.The allocation of seats in rows 0 to `maxRow` can be determined by this value, which indicates whether all group members can be seated.The seating arrangement of the group may or may not have all members sitting together.If the allocation of seats is possible, the `scatter` function should allocate `k` seats to the group.The seats in each row should have the smallest row numbers and the smallest possible seat numbers, ensuring that they adhere to the parameters of the method, where the number of rows is represented by 'n' and the number of seats per row is represented by 'm'.If it is not possible to allocate seats to the group, the `scatter` function should return `false` if the result is null.
