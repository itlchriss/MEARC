You are given an integer array `matchsticks` where `matchsticks[i]` is the length of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> matchstick. You want to use **all the matchsticks** to make one square. You **should not break** any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used **exactly one time**.
