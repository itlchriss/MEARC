The two parameters that the function should take are `sentence` and `searchWord`, where `sentence` represents the sentence to be analyzed and `searchWord` represents the word to search for.The index of the word in `sentence` where `searchWord` is a prefix of this word should be returned as an integer.The index of the first word that matches the prefix should be returned if the search word is a prefix of more than one word in the sentence. The index should be 1-indexed, meaning the first word has an index of 1.If the prefix `searchWord` is not found in any word within the `sentence`, the function should return -1.
