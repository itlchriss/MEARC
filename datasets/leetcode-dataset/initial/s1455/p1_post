The method returns an integer representing the index of the word in the `sentence` where `searchWord` is a prefix.
The returned index is 1-indexed.
If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, the method returns the index of the first word (minimum index).
If there is no word in the `sentence` that has `searchWord` as a prefix, the method returns -1.
