Find and return the index of the first word in the `sentence` parameter where the `searchWord` parameter is a prefix of that word. The index should be a 1-indexed value. If there are multiple words where `searchWord` is a prefix, return the index of the first occurrence. If there is no word in the sentence that has `searchWord` as a prefix, return -1.
