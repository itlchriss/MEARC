There is an `8 x 8` chessboard containing `n` pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array `pieces` of length `n`, where `pieces[i]` describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array `positions` also of length `n`, where <code>positions[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> piece is currently at the **1-based** coordinate <code>(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code> on the chessboard. You must make a **move** for every piece on the board simultaneously. A **move combination** consists of all the **moves** performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel **one square** towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> second. A move combination is **invalid** if, at a given time, **two or more** pieces occupy the same square.
