Given a 2D array of characters `grid` of size `m x n`, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the **same value** in `grid`.
A cycle is a path of **length 4 or more** in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the **same value** of the current cell.
