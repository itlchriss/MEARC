You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each <code>people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person of height <code>h<sub>i</sub></code> with **exactly** <code>k<sub>i</sub></code> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h<sub>i</sub></code>.
