Reconstruct and return _the queue that is represented by the input array_ `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where <code>queue[j] = [h<sub>j</sub>, k<sub>j</sub>]</code> is the attributes of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).
