The method should return a double value representing the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.
The returned probability should be between 0 and 1, inclusive.
If `n` is less than `k`, the method should return 0 as it is not possible for Alice to have `n` or fewer points.
If `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and `n` is less than or equal to `k+w-1`, the method should return 1 as Alice is guaranteed to have `n` or fewer points.
If `n` is greater than `k+w-1`, the method should calculate the probability based on the rules of the new 21 game.
