The returned array `perm` should not be null.
The length of the returned array `perm` should be equal to the length of the input string `s` plus one.
The elements of the returned array `perm` should be a permutation of the numbers from 0 to the length of the input string `s`, inclusive.
If the character at index i in the input string `s` is 'I', then the element at index i in the returned array `perm` should be smaller than the element at index i+If the character at index i in the input string `s` is 'D', then the element at index i in the returned array `perm` should be greater than the element at index i+1.
