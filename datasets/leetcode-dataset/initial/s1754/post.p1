Preconditions:
The method `largestMerge` takes two input parameters `word1` and `word2` of type String.
The input strings `word1` and `word2` are not null.

Postconditions:
The method returns a String which represents the lexicographically largest merge of `word1` and `word2`.
The returned merge is constructed by combining the characters from `word1` and `word2` in a way that produces the largest lexicographical order.
The returned merge contains all the characters from both `word1` and `word2`.
The order of characters in the returned merge is determined by their lexicographical order.
If there are multiple possible merges that result in the same lexicographically largest merge, the method can return any one of them.
