The output matrix `result` is not null.
The output matrix `result` has the same dimensions as the input matrix `mat`.
For each cell in the output matrix `result`, the value represents the distance to the nearest 0 in the input matrix `mat`.
The distance to the nearest 0 for each cell is calculated based on the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.
If a cell in the input matrix `mat` is already 0, the corresponding cell in the output matrix `result` will be The output matrix `result` is updated in a way that each cell's value is the minimum distance to a 0 from all the possible directions (up, down, left, right).
The output matrix `result` is updated in a way that each cell's value is the minimum distance to a 0 from all the possible directions (up, down, left, right) and diagonals (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).
