The total number of powerful integers should be calculated by the system, strictly adhering to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order.", without using any pronouns. This calculation should clearly apply to the method public long numberOfPowerfulInt(long start, long finish, int limit, String s), with the parameters start, finish, limit, and s explicitly related to the terms used.The range specified by the start and finish values should be considered by the system.The total number of powerful integers within the specified range should be returned by the system, where the range is determined by the parameters "start" and "finish". The limit parameter determines the maximum power that an integer can have to be considered powerful. The string parameter "s" is not used in this calculation.
