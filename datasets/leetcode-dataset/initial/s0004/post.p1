Preconditions:
The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be sorted in ascending order.
The input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must not be empty.
The lengths of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be `m` and `n` respectively.

Postconditions:
The method should return a double value representing the median of the two sorted arrays.
If the combined length of `nums1` and `nums2` is odd, the median should be the middle element.
If the combined length of `nums1` and `nums2` is even, the median should be the average of the two middle elements.
