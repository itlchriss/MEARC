The method returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a palindrome partition of the input string `s`.
Each inner list contains substrings of `s` that are palindromes.
The order of the substrings in each inner list is the same as the order in the input string `s`.
The order of the inner lists in the returned list represents different possible palindrome partitions of `s`.
The returned list does not contain any duplicate palindrome partitions.
The returned list contains all possible palindrome partitions of `s`.
