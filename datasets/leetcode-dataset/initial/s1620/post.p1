Preconditions:
- The input parameter `towers` is a 2D array of integers representing the towers' coordinates.
- The input parameter `radius` is a positive integer representing the radius of the network coverage.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an array of integers representing the coordinate with the maximum network quality.
- The returned coordinate is integral, meaning both `c_x` and `c_y` are integers.
- If there are multiple coordinates with the same maximum network quality, the method returns the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate.
