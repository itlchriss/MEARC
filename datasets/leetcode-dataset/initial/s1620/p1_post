The method returns an array of integers representing the coordinate with the maximum network quality.
The returned coordinate is integral, meaning both `c_x` and `c_y` are integers.
If there are multiple coordinates with the same maximum network quality, the method returns the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate.
