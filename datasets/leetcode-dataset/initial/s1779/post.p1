Preconditions:
- The method takes in three parameters: an integer x, an integer y, and a 2D integer array points.
- The array points contains valid and invalid points.
- The current location is represented by the coordinates (x, y).

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the index of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from the current location.
- If there are multiple valid points with the smallest Manhattan distance, the method returns the valid point with the smallest index.
- If there are no valid points, the method returns -1.
