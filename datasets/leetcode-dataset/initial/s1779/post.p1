Preconditions:
- The method takes in three parameters: an integer x, an integer y, and a 2D integer array points.
- The points array represents a list of points, where each point is represented by a pair of integers [x, y].
- The x and y parameters represent the current location.
- The points array may be empty or contain multiple points.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the index of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from the current location.
- The index is 0-indexed, meaning the first valid point has an index of - If there are multiple valid points with the smallest Manhattan distance, the method returns the valid point with the smallest index.
- If there are no valid points, the method returns -1.
