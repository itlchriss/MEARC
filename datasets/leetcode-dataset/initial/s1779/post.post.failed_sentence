Return _the index **(0-indexed)** of the **valid** point with the smallest **Manhattan distance** from your current location_. If there are multiple, return _the valid point with the **smallest** index_. If there are no valid points, return `-1`. **Explanation:** Of all the points, only [3,1], [2,4] and [4,4] are valid. Of the valid points, [2,4] and [4,4] have the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location, with a distance of 1. [2,4] has the smallest index, so return 2.
