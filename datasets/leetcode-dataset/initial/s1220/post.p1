The value to be returned by the function should not be null.The answer, which should be the returned value, should strictly adhere to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." The answer should clearly apply to the method public int countVowelPermutation(int n) by explicitly relating the parameter n to the term "The returned value".The outcome could potentially exceed the maximum value.The value should be returned after taking the modulo `10^9 + 7` of the answer.
