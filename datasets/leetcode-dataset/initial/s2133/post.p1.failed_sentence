The `n x n` integer matrix is the input that is being checked for validity.The validity of the matrix is determined by the presence of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in every row and column. The expected return value is `true` if the matrix meets this criterion.If the matrix is not valid, the expected return value of the function should be `false`.
