Given two numbers `arr1` and `arr2` in base **\-2**, return the result of adding them together.
Each number is given in _array format_: as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least significant bit. For example, `arr = [1,1,0,1]` represents the number `(-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3`. A number `arr` in _array, format_ is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either `arr == [0]` or `arr[0] == 1`.
