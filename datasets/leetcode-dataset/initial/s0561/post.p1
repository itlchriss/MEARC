Given a Java method with the signature `public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums)`, the objective is to group the `2n` integers in the integer array `nums` into `n` pairs `(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)` in order to maximize the sum of the minimum values between `a` and `b` for all pairs. The function should return the maximized sum.
