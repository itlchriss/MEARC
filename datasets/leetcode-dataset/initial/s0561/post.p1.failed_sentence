The input should be an integer array `nums` that contains an even number of integers.The integers in the `nums` array should be grouped into pairs, and the length of `nums` should be divided by two to determine the number of pairs.The array should be sorted in ascending order, with each pair consisting of two integers denoted as `(a_i, b_i)`. The sum of the minimum value between `a_i` and `b_i` should be maximized for all pairs.The maximized sum should be returned as the output by the system.
