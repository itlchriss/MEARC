Preconditions:
The input array `preorder` is not null.
The input array `preorder` is not empty.
The elements in the input array `preorder` are unique.

Postconditions:
The method returns the root of the constructed binary search tree.
The binary search tree constructed from the `preorder` array follows the preorder traversal order.
The binary search tree constructed from the `preorder` array is a valid binary search tree, i.e., for any node in the tree, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
