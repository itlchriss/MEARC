The output array contains all the elements of the input matrix `mat`.
The elements in the output array are arranged in a diagonal order.
The output array is not null.
The length of the output array is equal to the total number of elements in the input matrix `mat`.
The elements in the output array are ordered based on the diagonal traversal of the input matrix `mat`.
The diagonal order starts from the top-left element of the input matrix `mat` and ends at the bottom-right element.
