There is a network of `n` servers, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates there is a message channel between servers <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>, and they can pass **any** number of messages to **each other** directly in **one** second. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `patience` of length `n`.
