The length of the shortest cycle in the graph can be determined by the system.If the graph has no cycle, the length of the shortest cycle should be returned by the system.The length of the shortest cycle in the graph should be determined by the system when multiple requests are handled, with the parameter n representing the number of nodes in the graph and the parameter edges representing the array of edges in the graph.The method should handle various types of graphs, including directed or undirected graphs, by accepting the parameters 'n' and 'edges'.The method should handle graphs with varying numbers of nodes and edges.The method should handle graphs with cycles of varying lengths by accepting an integer parameter n representing the number of nodes in the graph and a 2D integer array parameter edges representing the connections between nodes.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include all nodes, given the parameters n and edges.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include only a subset of nodes, where the parameter n represents the number of nodes in the graph and the parameter edges represents the array of edges in the graph.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include duplicate nodes by explicitly relating the parameter "n" to "graphs with cycles" and the parameter "edges" to "duplicate nodes".The method should handle graphs with cycles that include self-loops by explicitly relating the parameter "n" to "graphs" and the parameter "edges" to "cycles".The method should handle graphs with cycles that include multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, given the parameters n and edges.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include both directed and undirected edges, where the parameter n represents the number of vertices in the graph, and the parameter edges represents the array of edges in the graph.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include both positive and negative edge weights, where the parameter n represents the number of vertices in the graph and the parameter edges represents the array of edges in the graph.The method should handle graphs that include zero-weight edges in cycles.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include both simple and complex paths, where the parameter n represents the number of nodes in the graph, and the parameter edges represents the array of edges in the graph.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include both even and odd numbers of nodes, where the parameter n represents the number of nodes in the graph and the parameter edges represents the array of edges in the graph.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include both simple and complex topologies, where the parameter n represents the number of nodes in the graph, and the parameter edges represents the array of edges in the graph.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include both connected and disconnected components, where the parameter n represents the number of nodes in the graph, and the parameter edges represents the array of edges in the graph.The method should handle graphs with cycles that include both regular and irregular structures, where the parameter n represents the number of nodes in the graph and the parameter edges represents the array of edges in the graph.
