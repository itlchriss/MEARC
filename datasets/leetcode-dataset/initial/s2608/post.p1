Preconditions:
The method should take two parameters: an integer n representing the number of nodes in the graph, and a 2D array edges representing the edges between the nodes.
The value of n should be greater than or equal to The length of the edges array should be greater than or equal to The edges array should only contain valid node indices, i.e., indices ranging from 0 to n-The edges array should not contain duplicate edges.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer representing the length of the shortest cycle in the graph.
If no cycle exists in the graph, the method should return -1.
