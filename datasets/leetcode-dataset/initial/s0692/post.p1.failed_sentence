If an array of strings `words` and an integer `k` are given as input, the system should proceed.After receiving the input, the system should determine the `k` most frequent strings from the given array, where the array is represented by the parameter `words`.After the `k` most frequent strings are determined, the subsequent step involves sorting them in descending order based on their frequency.The words in the parameter array should be sorted according to their lexicographical order after completing the sorting process, if they have the same frequency.The `k` most frequent strings should be included in the sorted order, as a conclusion.
