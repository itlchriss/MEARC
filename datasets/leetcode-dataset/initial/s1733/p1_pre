The method minimumTeachings takes in three parameters: an integer n representing the number of users, a 2D integer array languages representing the languages known by each user, and a 2D integer array friendships representing the friendships between users.
The languages array has n rows and an arbitrary number of columns, where each row represents a user and each column represents a language known by that user. The value at languages[i][j] represents the jth language known by the ith user.
The friendships array has an arbitrary number of rows and 2 columns, where each row represents a friendship between two users. The value at friendships[i][0] represents the first user in the friendship, and the value at friendships[i][1] represents the second user in the friendship.
