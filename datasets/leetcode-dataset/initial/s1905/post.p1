Preconditions:
The method should take two 2D integer arrays, `grid1` and `grid2`, as input parameters.
Both `grid1` and `grid2` should have the same dimensions.
The elements in `grid1` and `grid2` should only be 0 or 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the number of islands in `grid2` that are considered sub-islands.
An island in `grid2` is considered a sub-island if all the land cells in that island are also present in `grid1`.
The method should count and consider each separate island in `grid2` individually.
If there are no islands in `grid2`, the method should return 0.
