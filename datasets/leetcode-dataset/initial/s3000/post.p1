To find the area of the rectangle with the longest diagonal among multiple rectangles, we need to iterate through each rectangle's dimensions. If a rectangle has a longer diagonal than the previous rectangles, we update the maximum diagonal length and calculate its area. Finally, we return the area of the rectangle with the maximum area. For example, if the rectangle at index 1 has a greater diagonal length, we can calculate its area by multiplying its length (8) and width (6), resulting in an area of 48.
