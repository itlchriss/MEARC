The method should return a long value representing the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.
If there are no pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other, the method should return If there are pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other, the method should return the count of such pairs.
The method should handle cases where there are disconnected nodes in the graph and calculate the count of pairs accordingly.
