The method returns an integer representing the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing the operation at most k times.
The answer key remains unchanged after the method is executed.
If k is 0, the method returns the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the original answer key.
If k is greater than the number of 'T's or 'F's in the answer key, the method returns the length of the answer key.
If k is equal to the number of 'T's or 'F's in the answer key, the method returns the length of the answer key.
If k is less than the number of 'T's or 'F's in the answer key, the method returns the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing k operations.
