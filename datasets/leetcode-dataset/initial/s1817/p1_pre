The method `findingUsersActiveMinutes` should take in a 2D integer array `logs` and an integer `k` as parameters.
The `logs` array should contain user activity logs, where each log is represented by a pair of integers [id, minute].
The `k` parameter represents the desired active minutes for which we need to find the users.
