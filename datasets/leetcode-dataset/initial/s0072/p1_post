The method should return an integer value representing the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.
The returned value should be non-negative.
If `word1` and `word2` are already the same, the method should return If `word1` and `word2` have different lengths, the method should return the absolute difference between their lengths.
The operations allowed to convert `word1` to `word2` include insertion, deletion, and substitution of characters.
The method should consider the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2` by using the most efficient approach.
