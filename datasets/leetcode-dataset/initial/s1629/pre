You are given a string `keysPressed` of length `n`, where `keysPressed[i]` was the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list `releaseTimes`, where `releaseTimes[i]` was the time the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> key was released. Both arrays are **0-indexed**. The <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> key was pressed at the time `0`, and every subsequent key was pressed at the **exact** time the previous key was released.
