The method returns an integer array `answer`.
If there are two indices `i` and `j` in the input array `nums` such that `nums[i] - nums[j] = valueDifference` and `i - j = indexDifference`, then `answer` is equal to `[i, j]`.
If there are no two indices `i` and `j` in the input array `nums` that satisfy the conditions, then `answer` is equal to `[-1, -1]`.
