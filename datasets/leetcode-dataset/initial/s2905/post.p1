Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` has at least two elements.
- The input integer `indexDifference` is non-negative.
- The input integer `valueDifference` is non-negative.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer array `answer`.
- If there are two indices `i` and `j` in the input array `nums` such that `nums[i] - nums[j] = valueDifference` and `i - j = indexDifference`, then `answer` is equal to `[i, j]`.
- If there are no two indices `i` and `j` in the input array `nums` that satisfy the conditions, then `answer` is equal to `[-1, -1]`.
