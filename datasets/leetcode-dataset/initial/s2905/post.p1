When the method `findIndices` is called with the parameters `nums`, `indexDifference`, and `valueDifference`, it returns an integer array named `answer`. If there exist two specific indices in the `nums` array that satisfy the given conditions, the `answer` array will contain those indices as [i, j]. However, if there are no such indices that meet the conditions, the `answer` array will be [-1, -1]. It is important to note that any of the indices that satisfy the conditions can be returned.
