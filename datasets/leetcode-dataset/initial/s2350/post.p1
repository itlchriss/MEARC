Preconditions:
- The method takes in an array of integers `rolls` and an integer `k` as parameters.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the length of the shortest sequence of rolls that cannot be taken from the given `rolls` array.

Additional behavioural requirements:
- The method should handle the case when the `rolls` array is empty and return - The method should handle the case when the `rolls` array contains only one element and return - The method should handle the case when the `rolls` array contains multiple elements and return the length of the shortest sequence that cannot be taken from the `rolls` array.
- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is negative and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is greater than the maximum value in the `rolls` array and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is equal to the maximum value in the `rolls` array and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is equal to the minimum value in the `rolls` array and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is equal to the sum of all elements in the `rolls` array and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is equal to the product of all elements in the `rolls` array and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the `rolls` array and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is equal to the sum of all elements in the `rolls` array minus the maximum value and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is equal to the sum of all elements in the `rolls` array minus the minimum value and return -- The method should handle the case when the `k` parameter is equal to the sum of all elements in the `rolls` array minus the maximum and minimum values and return -1.
