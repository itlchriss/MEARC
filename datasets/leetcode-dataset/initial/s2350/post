The sequence [1, 4, 2] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 3. The sequence [2, 1] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 2. **Explanation:** The sequence [4] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 1. Note that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but [4] is the shortest.
Return _the length of the **shortest** sequence of rolls that **cannot** be taken from_ `rolls`.
