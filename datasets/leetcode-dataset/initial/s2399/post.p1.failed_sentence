If the input string `s` is a well-spaced string, the system should return `true`.If the input string `s` is not a well-spaced string, the system should return `false`.The input string `s` should be a well-spaced string, even if it contains leading or trailing spaces, for the system to return `true`.If the input string `s` is not a well-spaced string, the system should return `false`, even if it contains leading or trailing spaces.If the input string `s` is a well-spaced string, the system should return `true`, even if it contains multiple consecutive spaces.If the input string `s` is not a well-spaced string, the system should return `false`, even if it contains multiple consecutive spaces.The input string `s` should contain both uppercase and lowercase characters, and the array `distance` should be sorted in ascending order.The input string `s` should contain special characters and numbers, and the array `distance` should be handled by the system.The input string `s` should be handled as an empty string by the system, and the `distance` array should be sorted in ascending order. The system should then return `false`.The input should consist of single character strings, and the method should return `true`.The input string should consist only of spaces, and the method should return `true`.The input string `s` should consist solely of spaces, including any spaces at the beginning or end, and the method should return `true`.The input string, which may consist of multiple consecutive spaces, should be handled by the system. The system should return `true` if the input string contains only spaces.
