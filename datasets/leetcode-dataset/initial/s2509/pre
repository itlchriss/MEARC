You are given an integer `n`. There is a **complete binary tree** with <code>2<sup>n</sup> - 1</code> nodes. The root of that tree is the node with the value `1`, and every node with a value `val` in the range <code>[1, 2<sup>n - 1</sup> - 1]</code> has two children where: You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where <code>queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For each query, solve the following problem:
