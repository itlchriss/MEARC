Preconditions:
The input integer `n` must be a non-negative number.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.
If `n` is less than 5, the method should return 0, as there are no trailing zeroes in the factorial of numbers less than If `n` is equal to or greater than 5, the method should calculate the factorial of `n` and count the number of trailing zeroes in the result.
The method should handle large values of `n` and return the correct number of trailing zeroes.
The method should handle negative values of `n` and return an appropriate error or exception message.
The method should handle decimal values of `n` and return an appropriate error or exception message.
The method should handle non-integer values of `n` and return an appropriate error or exception message.
