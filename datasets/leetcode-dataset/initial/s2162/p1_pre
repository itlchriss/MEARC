The startAt parameter represents the initial cooking time in seconds.
The moveCost parameter represents the cost of moving the cooking time by one second.
The pushCost parameter represents the cost of pushing the cooking time to the targetSeconds.
The targetSeconds parameter represents the desired cooking time in seconds.
