The method should return an integer value representing the minimum cost to set the targetSeconds of cooking time.
The returned cost should be calculated based on the given startAt, moveCost, pushCost, and targetSeconds.
The minimum cost should be determined by either moving the cooking time by one second or pushing it to the targetSeconds.
The method should handle cases where the startAt is already equal to the targetSeconds and return a cost of The method should handle cases where the startAt is greater than the targetSeconds and return a cost of (startAt - targetSeconds) * moveCost.
The method should handle cases where the startAt is less than the targetSeconds and return a cost of (targetSeconds - startAt) * pushCost.
