The input for the system should consist of an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, where `nums` represents the array of integers and `k` represents the number of top frequent elements to be returned.The array `nums` should contain the `k` most frequent elements, as determined by the system.The `k` most frequent elements should be returned by the system.The array of integers, nums, should be sorted in ascending order, and the system should allow the top k frequent elements to be returned in any order.The condition should be handled by the system in cases where the array `nums` is empty.The condition should be handled by the system in cases where the value of the integer `k` exceeds the length of the array `nums`.The case where the integer `k` is zero should be handled by the system.The scenario where the array `nums` includes duplicate elements should be managed by the system.The condition of the array `nums` containing negative integers should be handled by the system.The case where the array `nums` contains only one element should be handled by the system.The array `nums` should be handled by the system in cases where it contains multiple elements with the same frequency.
