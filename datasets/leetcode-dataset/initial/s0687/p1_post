The method returns an integer representing the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value.
The returned length includes the root node if it is part of the longest path.
The returned length does not include the root node if it is not part of the longest path.
If the binary tree is empty (i.e., the `root` is null), the method returns 0.
