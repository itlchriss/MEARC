Preconditions:
The method should take three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `maxDistance`, and a two-dimensional integer array `roads`.
The value of `n` should be a positive integer representing the total number of branches.
The value of `maxDistance` should be a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between any two branches.
The `roads` array should contain `n` rows and `n` columns, representing the distances between each pair of branches.
The values in the `roads` array should be non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer representing the number of possible sets of closing branches.
Each set of closing branches should satisfy the condition that the distance between any two branches in the set is at most `maxDistance`.
The returned value should be non-negative.
