The method should take three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `maxDistance`, and a two-dimensional integer array `roads`.
The value of `n` should be a positive integer representing the total number of branches.
The value of `maxDistance` should be a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between any two branches.
The `roads` array should contain `n` rows and `n` columns, representing the distances between each pair of branches.
The values in the `roads` array should be non-negative integers.
