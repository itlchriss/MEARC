The integer array `nums` should be sorted in ascending order. If there exists a triple of indices `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`, the function should return `true`. Otherwise, it should return `false`.To identify a valid triplet, the function must examine all potential combinations of indices. It should compare the values at these indices, denoted as `i`, `j`, and `k`, to determine if `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`.The function should account for all potential values of `i`, `j`, and `k` within the specified array bounds. It should also handle scenarios where the array `nums` is either empty or contains less than three elements. In such cases, the function should return `false`.Furthermore, the method should have the capability to handle scenarios where the parameter array, referred to as `nums`, contains duplicate elements, negative numbers, floating-point numbers, large numbers, both positive and negative numbers, ascending and descending sequences, repeated sequences, and only one unique number.The expected behavior is for the method to return `true` if the array `nums` contains multiple sets of three indices that are valid and increasing in order. However, the method should only return `true` once.If the condition is not satisfied by any of the valid triples, `false` should be returned.At the beginning, middle, or end of the array `nums`, a valid triple of indices should be found, ensuring that it strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."
