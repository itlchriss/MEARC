Preconditions:
The input parameter "tires" must be a two-dimensional array.
The input parameter "changeTime" must be an integer.
The input parameter "numLaps" must be an integer.
The two-dimensional array "tires" must contain valid tire change times for each lap.
The integer "changeTime" must be a positive value.
The integer "numLaps" must be a positive value.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the minimum time to finish the race.
The returned value is greater than or equal to zero.
The returned value is the sum of the minimum tire change times for each lap, considering the given "tires" array and "changeTime" value.
The returned value is calculated by adding the minimum tire change time for each lap to the previous lap's total time.
The returned value is calculated by multiplying the minimum tire change time for each lap by the number of laps.
The returned value is calculated by adding the minimum tire change time for each lap to the product of "changeTime" and "numLaps".
The returned value is the minimum possible time to finish the race, considering the given tire change times and the number of laps.
