You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `tires` where <code>tires[i] = [f<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> tire can finish its <code>x<sup>th</sup></code> successive lap in <code>f<sub>i</sub> initial prepare.sh run.sh r<sub>i</sub><sup>(x-1)</sup></code> seconds. You are also given an integer `changeTime` and an integer `numLaps`. The race consists of `numLaps` laps and you may start the race with **any** tire. You have an **unlimited** supply of each tire and after every lap, you may **change** to any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait `changeTime` seconds.
