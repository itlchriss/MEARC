The array of strings (`arr`) and the integer (`k`) are the input for the method.The string returned by the method is not null.The `k`th distinct string present in the `arr` should be returned by the function.If the number of distinct strings in the parameter array is less than `k`, the function should return an empty string (`str_`).The array should be considered sorted in ascending order if the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The first distinct string encountered when counting from left to right in the array should be returned by the function, given the parameters arr and k.In the scenario where the value of `k` is equal to 1, the first distinct string should be returned by the function, effectively handling such cases.In the scenario where the number of distinct strings in the array is equal to `k`, the last distinct string should be returned by the function.In cases where the number of distinct strings in the array is less than `k`, the expected output of the function should be an empty string.In the scenario where the array provided as a parameter is empty, the expected behavior of the function is to return an empty string.
