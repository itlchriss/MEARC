The method returns a list of integers representing the values of the nodes visible from the right side of the binary tree.
The list is ordered from top to bottom, meaning the first element in the list corresponds to the topmost visible node and the last element corresponds to the bottommost visible node.
The list may contain duplicate values if multiple nodes have the same value.
The list may be empty if there are no nodes in the binary tree.
The list does not include any values from nodes that are not visible from the right side of the binary tree.
