Calculate and return the maximum possible increase in the total sum of building heights, while ensuring that the skyline of the city remains unchanged when viewed from any cardinal direction. The algorithm should be implemented in a Java method with the signature public int maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(int[][] grid), where the grid parameter represents the current building heights and the return type is an integer representing the maximum increase.
