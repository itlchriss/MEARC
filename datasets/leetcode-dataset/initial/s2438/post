Return _an array_ `answers`_, equal in length to_ `queries`_, where_ `answers[i]` _is the answer to the_ <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> _query_. Since the answer to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query may be too large, each `answers[i]` should be returned **modulo** <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>. Each answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7 yields the same answer, so [2,4,64] is returned. **Explanation:** For n = 2, powers = [2]. The answer to the only query is powers[0] = 2. The answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7 is the same, so [2] is returned.
