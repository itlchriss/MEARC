The integer array `nums` and the integer `k` are the input for this method.The length of the shortest non-empty subarray of `nums` that has a sum of at least `k` is represented by the output.If the array `nums` does not contain a subarray with a sum of at least `k`, the output will be - The subarray must include at least one element from the original array `nums` as it cannot be empty.The count of elements in the subarray is equal to its length.The sum of all elements in the subarray must be greater than or equal to `k`, indicating that the subarray must have a minimum sum of `k`.The length of the subarray, which should be minimized, ensures that it is as short as possible while still meeting the requirement of the sum, given the parameters nums and k.The array `nums` can contain integers of both positive and negative values.The input array `nums` allows for duplicate elements.The `nums` array can have no elements.The integer `k` can have a positive, negative, or zero value as the input parameter.The array `nums` can have elements whose sum is less than the input integer `k`.If the integer `k` in the input array `nums` is equal to zero, then the subarray contained within `nums` must have a sum that is greater than or equal to zero.If the integer `k` provided as input is negative, the subarray within the `nums` array must have a sum that is at least equal to the absolute value of `k`.
