Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.
Return _a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of_ `searchWord` _is typed_.
