 an array of strings called `products` and a string called `searchWord`. It returns a list of lists of strings. 

To apply this method, design a system that suggests, at most, three product names from the `products` list after each character of `searchWord` is typed. These suggested products should have a common prefix with the `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix, the system should return the three lexicographically minimum products. 

To achieve this, you can use the Java methods `Trie()` and `Node()`. Avoid using pronouns and dangling modifiers in your description.
