Preconditions:
The input parameter `board` is a 2D array of integers representing the snakes and ladders board.
The size of the board is `n x n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
The board is a valid snakes and ladders board, with the following conditions:
   a. The first square is numbered 1 and the last square is numbered `n^2`.
   b. The board may contain snakes and ladders, represented by negative and positive numbers respectively.
   c. The board does not contain any other numbers apart from the snakes and ladders.
   d. The snakes and ladders on the board are valid, i.e., they do not go beyond the board boundaries.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the least number of moves required to reach the last square `n^2`.
If it is not possible to reach the last square, the method returns `-1`.
The returned value is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square.
