Preconditions:
The method `oddCells` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of rows in the matrix), `m` (an integer representing the number of columns in the matrix), and `indices` (a 2D integer array representing the locations to increment).
The value of `n` should be greater than The value of `m` should be greater than The length of the `indices` array should be greater than Each element in the `indices` array should be a 2-element array representing the row and column indices to increment.
The row index in each element of the `indices` array should be within the range of 0 to `n-1`.
The column index in each element of the `indices` array should be within the range of 0 to `m-1`.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer representing the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in `indices`.
The matrix is a 2D array of size `n` x `m`.
All cells in the matrix are initially set to For each element in the `indices` array, the value at the corresponding row and column index in the matrix is incremented by After applying the increments, the method counts the number of cells in the matrix that have an odd value.
The method returns the count of odd-valued cells in the matrix.
