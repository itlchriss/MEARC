The method `oddCells` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of rows in the matrix), `m` (an integer representing the number of columns in the matrix), and `indices` (a 2D integer array representing the locations to increment).
The value of `n` should be greater than The value of `m` should be greater than The length of the `indices` array should be greater than Each element in the `indices` array should be a 2-element array representing the row and column indices to increment.
The row index in each element of the `indices` array should be within the range of 0 to `n-1`.
The column index in each element of the `indices` array should be within the range of 0 to `m-1`.
