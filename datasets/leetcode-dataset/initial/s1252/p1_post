The method returns an integer representing the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in `indices`.
The matrix is a 2D array of size `n` x `m`.
All cells in the matrix are initially set to For each element in the `indices` array, the value at the corresponding row and column index in the matrix is incremented by After applying the increments, the method counts the number of cells in the matrix that have an odd value.
The method returns the count of odd-valued cells in the matrix.
