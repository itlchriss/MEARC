Preconditions:
The method should take two parameters: an integer `numCourses` representing the total number of courses and a 2D integer array `prerequisites` representing the prerequisites for each course.
The `numCourses` parameter should be a positive integer.
The `prerequisites` parameter should not be null.
The `prerequisites` parameter should have a length equal to the number of courses.
Each element in the `prerequisites` parameter should be an array of length 2, representing the prerequisite course and the course itself.
The prerequisite course should be a valid course number (between 0 and `numCourses-1`).
The course itself should be a valid course number (between 0 and `numCourses-1`).
There should not be any duplicate prerequisite-course pairs in the `prerequisites` parameter.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer array representing the ordering of courses to finish all courses.
If there are multiple valid answers, the method can return any of them.
If it is impossible to finish all courses, the method should return an empty array.
