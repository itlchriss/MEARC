To determine if it is possible to split everyone into two groups based on their dislikes, we are given an integer `n` and an array `dislikes` where each element `dislikes[i]` represents a pair of people labeled `a_i` and `b_i`, indicating that person `a_i` dislikes person `b_i`. The return value of the method `possibleBipartition` will be `true` only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this manner.
