The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function `Successor(x, curOrder)`, which given a person `x` and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after `x` in the order of inheritance. initial prepare.sh run.sh `ThroneInheritance(string kingName)` Initializes an object of the `ThroneInheritance` class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.
