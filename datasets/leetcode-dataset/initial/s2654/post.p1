To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the given integer array nums equal to 1, an algorithm needs to be implemented. The algorithm should consider the input parameter nums, which is an array of integers. If it is impossible to make all elements equal to 1, the algorithm should return -1 as the result.
