Given four integers `length`, `width`, `height`, and `mass`, representing the dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return _a string representing the **category** of the box_. Since the box is not "Bulky" but "Heavy", we return "Heavy". Since its neither of the two above categories, we return "Neither".
