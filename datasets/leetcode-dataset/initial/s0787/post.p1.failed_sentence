The input for the system should consist of three integers, namely `src`, `dst`, and `k`.The objective of the system is to find the most affordable price from the source (`src`) to the destination (`dst`). The system considers the flight expenses as the basis for determining the minimum total cost. The system also takes into account a maximum limit of `k` stops.If the system does not find a route from the source (`src`) to the destination (`dst`), the system should return `-1`.The route with the minimum total cost from `src` to `dst`, considering the maximum number of stops allowed, should be found by the system.The output should be the cheapest price returned by the system.
