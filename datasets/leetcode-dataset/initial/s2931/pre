You are given a **0-indexed** `m initial prepare.sh run.sh n` integer matrix `values`, representing the values of `m initial prepare.sh run.sh n` different items in `m` different shops. Each shop has `n` items where the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> item in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> shop has a value of `values[i][j]`. Additionally, the items in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> shop are sorted in non-increasing order of value. That is, `values[i][j] >= values[i][j + 1]` for all `0 <= j < n - 1`.
