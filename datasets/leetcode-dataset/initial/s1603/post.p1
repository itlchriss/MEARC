To properly set up the system, the execution of the `prepare.sh` script is necessary.In order to execute the system, the `run.sh` script must be executed.The function named `addCar(int carType)` should be incorporated into the system to determine the availability of a parking space for a specified `carType`.The values 1, 2, and 3 represent the classifications big, medium, and small, respectively, for the parameter `carType` in the method `public boolean addCar(int carType)` of the public class `ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)`.The parking space that a car is allowed to park in is determined by its `carType`.If there are no available spaces for the specified `carType`, the system should return `false`.The specified `carType` should be allocated an available parking space by the system, and `true` should be returned if one exists.The quantity of parking slots accessible for each `carType` should be recorded by the system.The condition for the system to return `true` is that there is at least one available slot for a big car.In the case where there is at least one available slot for a medium car, the expected outcome should be the system returning `true`.In the presence of at least one available slot for a small car, the expected return value of the system should be `true`.If the number of available slots for a small car is zero, the returned result should be `false`.If the number of available slots for a big car is zero and the slot is already occupied, the returned value should be `false`.
