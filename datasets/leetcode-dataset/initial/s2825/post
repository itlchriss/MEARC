**Explanation:** Select index 2 in str1. Increment str1[2] to become 'd'. Hence, str1 becomes "abd" and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned. **Explanation:** Select indices 0 and 1 in str1. Increment str1[0] to become 'a'. Increment str1[1] to become 'd'. Hence, str1 becomes "ad" and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned. **Explanation:** In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 using the operation at most once. Therefore, false is returned.
Return `true` _if it is possible to make_ `str2` _a subsequence of_ `str1` _by performing the operation **at most once**_, _and_ `false` _otherwise_.
