The input parameter `n` represents the number of vertices in the graph.
The input parameter `edges` represents the edges of the graph, where each element in the array is an array of two integers representing the vertices connected by the edge.
The input parameter `src1` represents the source vertex - The input parameter `src2` represents the source vertex - The input parameter `dest` represents the destination vertex.
The graph is represented by the input parameters `n` and `edges`.
The graph is a connected graph.
The graph may contain cycles.
The graph may contain self-loops.
The graph may contain multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
