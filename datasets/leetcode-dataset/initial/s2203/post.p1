Preconditions:
- The input parameter `n` represents the number of vertices in the graph.
- The input parameter `edges` represents the edges of the graph, where each element in the array is an array of two integers representing the vertices connected by the edge.
- The input parameter `src1` represents the source vertex - The input parameter `src2` represents the source vertex - The input parameter `dest` represents the destination vertex.
- The graph is represented by the input parameters `n` and `edges`.
- The graph is a connected graph.
- The graph may contain cycles.
- The graph may contain self-loops.
- The graph may contain multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

Postconditions:
- The method returns the minimum weight of a subgraph of the graph.
- The subgraph must be such that it is possible to reach the destination vertex `dest` from both source vertices `src1` and `src2` via a set of edges of this subgraph.
- If such a subgraph does not exist, the method returns -1.
