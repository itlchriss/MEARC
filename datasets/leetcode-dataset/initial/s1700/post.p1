2. This modification is done by changing the value of the front student in the students array to 0.
3. The modified students array is then updated accordingly.
4. Steps 1-3 are repeated until either all sandwiches are consumed or there are no more students in the line.

After the algorithm is executed, the method returns the count of students who were unable to eat, which is the number of remaining students in the students array with a value of 1.
