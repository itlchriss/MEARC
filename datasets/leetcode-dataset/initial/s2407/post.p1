Preconditions and postconditions for the Java methods:

public SegTree(int n):
   - Precondition: None
   - Postcondition: A SegTree object is created with a size of n.

public int query(int l, int r):
   - Precondition: A SegTree object has been created.
   - Postcondition: Returns the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements within the range [l, r].

public void update(int i, int val):
   - Precondition: A SegTree object has been created.
   - Postcondition: Updates the value at index i in the SegTree with the new value val.

public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums, int k):
   - Precondition: None
   - Postcondition: Returns the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements in the given array nums, considering the constraint k.
