Preconditions:
- The input array `edges` is not null.
- The input array `edges` has at least two elements.
- The values in the input array `edges` are non-negative integers.
- The values in the input array `edges` represent the distances between nodes.
- The input integers `node1` and `node2` are valid indices within the input array `edges`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the index of the node that can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`.
- The returned index is the node that minimizes the maximum distance between `node1` and `node2`.
- If there are multiple nodes that satisfy the above condition, the method returns the node with the smallest index.
- If no node can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`, the method returns -1.
