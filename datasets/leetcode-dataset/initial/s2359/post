Return _the **index** of the node that can be reached from both_ `node1` _and_ `node2`_, such that the **maximum** between the distance from_ `node1` _to that node, and from_ `node2` _to that node is **minimized**_. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the **smallest** index, and if no possible answer exists, return `-1`. The maximum of those two distances is 1. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 1, so we return node 2. The maximum of those two distances is 2. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 2, so we return node 2.
