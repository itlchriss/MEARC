The method returns an integer representing the index of the node that can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`.
The returned index is the node that minimizes the maximum distance between `node1` and `node2`.
If there are multiple nodes that satisfy the above condition, the method returns the node with the smallest index.
If no node can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`, the method returns -1.
