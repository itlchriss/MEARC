All nodes in the binary tree that have a sum of values less than the `limit` should be deleted.
The resulting binary tree should have all nodes with a sum of values greater than or equal to the `limit`.
The resulting binary tree should maintain its structure, with all parent-child relationships intact.
The resulting binary tree should have the same number of nodes as the original binary tree, or fewer if some nodes were deleted.
The resulting binary tree should have the same values for all nodes that were not deleted.
The resulting binary tree should have the same root as the original binary tree.
