The input for the function should be a linked list with the variable name `head`.The array returned by the function should have a length that represents the number of nodes between any two distinct critical points. The array should contain the minimum distance and maximum distance between these critical points.If the number of critical points is less than two, the function should return `[-1, -1]`.
