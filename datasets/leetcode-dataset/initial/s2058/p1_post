The method returns an array of length 2 containing `[minDistance, maxDistance]`.
If there are fewer than two critical points in the linked list, the method returns `[-1, -1]`.
The minimum distance `minDistance` is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points.
The maximum distance `maxDistance` is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points.
