Preconditions:
The input grid must be a 2-dimensional array.
The grid must not be null.
The grid must have at least one row and one column.
Each element in the grid must be a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the total surface area of the resulting shapes.
The returned surface area should be non-negative.
The returned surface area should be the sum of the surface areas of all shapes in the grid.
The surface area of each shape should be calculated by adding the surface areas of its individual cells.
The surface area of a cell should be calculated by multiplying its value by If two shapes are adjacent, the shared boundary between them should not be counted twice in the total surface area.
The total surface area should be calculated by summing the surface areas of all cells in the grid and subtracting the surface areas of adjacent cells.
