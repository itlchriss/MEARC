You are given two positive integer arrays `spells` and `potions`, of length `n` and `m` respectively, where `spells[i]` represents the strength of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> spell and `potions[j]` represents the strength of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> potion. You are also given an integer `success`. A spell and potion pair is considered **successful** if the **product** of their strengths is **at least** `success`.
