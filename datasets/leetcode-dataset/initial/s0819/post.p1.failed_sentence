The input parameters for the function are `paragraph`, which is a string, and `banned`, which is a string array. These parameters should be accepted as arguments in the function.The string returned by the function should not be null.The string that should be the most frequent word in the `paragraph` and is not present in the `banned` array is this string, and the comparisons for case-insensitivity should be handled by the function.The condition is that the words in the `paragraph` parameter should be treated as lowercase when comparing them.The outcome should not be null.In the case where there is at least one word in the `paragraph` that is not banned, the function should convert the most frequent word to lowercase before returning it.In the case where there is a word that is not present in the `banned` array, the function should still have the capability to identify the most frequent word among those non-banned words. This means that the function should be able to handle situations where the answer is unique.If there exists only one most frequent word that is not banned, the function should be capable of identifying and returning that word.
