The 2D integer array should be returned in ascending order by value, provided that the items are returned as a List of Lists of Integers.The 2D integer array should be returned as the result, where each item in the array should follow the format [value, weight]. The items in the array should strictly adhere to the syntax mentioned above, and the pronoun "they" should refer to the items. The parameter arrays arr1 and arr2 should be merged by the method mergeSimilarItems.The array arr1 contains sorted subarrays in ascending order, while the array arr2 contains subarrays that are not null. Each subarray in arr1 refers to an item.The sum of weights of all items with the same value should be the weight of each item, which can be calculated by adding the weights of the items with the same value, given that the parameter arrays arr1 and arr2 are sorted in ascending order.The weight is referred to as str_which, and it is not null.The values and weights from the given requirements should be extracted, and the extracted values and weights should be stored in the ret array.The value and weight are referred to as str_they, and they are not null.
