The returned string array must not be null.
The length of the returned string array must be equal to the number of groups `s` has been divided into.
Each element in the returned string array must be a non-null string.
Each element in the returned string array must have a length equal to `k`, except for the last element which may have a length less than `k` if the length of `s` is not divisible by `k`.
Each element in the returned string array must be composed of characters from the original string `s` and the character `fill`.
The composition of every group in the returned string array must follow the above procedure, which involves dividing `s` into groups of size `k` and filling any remaining spaces in the last group with the character `fill`.
