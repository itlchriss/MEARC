**Explanation:** The graph above contains the initial edges. It is not possible to make the distance from 0 to 2 equal to 6 by modifying the edge with weight -1. So, an empty array is returned.
Return _an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if it is possible to make the shortest distance from_ `source` _to_ `destination` _equal to_ `target`_, or an **empty array** if it's impossible._
