Preconditions:
- The input integer `n` represents the number of nodes in the graph.
- The input 2D array `edges` represents the initial edges of the graph.
- The input integer `source` represents the starting node.
- The input integer `destination` represents the destination node.
- The input integer `target` represents the desired shortest distance from `source` to `destination`.

Postconditions:
- If it is possible to modify the edges of the graph to achieve the desired shortest distance from `source` to `destination` equal to `target`, the method should return an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order.
- If it is not possible to achieve the desired shortest distance, the method should return an empty array.
