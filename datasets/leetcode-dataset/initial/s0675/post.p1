The point (0, 0) should be the starting point for the system.The minimum steps required to walk to cut off all the trees should be calculated by the system.If it is not possible to cut off all the trees, the method should return -The system should keep track of the current position while walking.The distance between the current position and each tree should be determined by the system.The minimum distance should be prioritized for cutting off trees.After cutting off a tree, the current position should be updated by the system.The process should be repeated until all trees are cut off or until it is no longer possible to cut off any more trees, in the method public int cutOffTree(List<List<Integer>> forest), where the parameter forest represents the array of trees.The total number of steps taken should be kept track of by the system.The minimum number of steps taken to cut off all the trees should be returned.
