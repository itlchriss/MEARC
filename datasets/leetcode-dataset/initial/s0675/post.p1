Preconditions:
The input `forest` is a non-empty list of lists, representing a 2D grid of integers.
The grid has at least one tree, represented by a positive integer.
The grid has at most 50 rows and 50 columns.
The values in the grid are non-negative integers.
The starting point `(0, 0)` is a valid position in the grid.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of steps required to cut off all the trees.
If it is not possible to cut off all the trees, the method returns `-1`.
The method does not modify the input `forest` list.
The method does not modify the values in the grid.
The method does not modify the starting point `(0, 0)`.

Note: Additional requirements may exist depending on the specific implementation of the method.
