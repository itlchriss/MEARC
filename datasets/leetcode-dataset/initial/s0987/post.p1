Preconditions:
The input binary tree must not be null.

Postconditions:
The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a vertical level of the binary tree.
Each inner list should contain the values of the nodes in the corresponding vertical level, ordered from top to bottom and left to right.
The values within each inner list should be integers.
The order of the inner lists should be based on the vertical order of the nodes in the binary tree.
If there are multiple nodes at the same vertical level, their order within the inner list should be based on their horizontal order in the binary tree.
