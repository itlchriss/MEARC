Preconditions:
The input parameter "roads" must be a 2-dimensional array representing the road network.
The input parameter "seats" must be a positive integer representing the number of seats available in the vehicle.
The road network must be connected, i.e., there must be a path from any city to the capital city.
The road network must not contain any negative distances or fuel costs.

Postconditions:
The method should return a long value representing the minimum number of liters of fuel required to reach the capital city.
The returned value should be greater than or equal to zero.
If it is not possible to reach the capital city from any city in the road network, the method should return -1 or a specific value indicating that it is not possible.
The method should handle cases where the number of seats is greater than the number of cities in the road network. In such cases, it should return -1 or a specific value indicating that it is not possible to accommodate all passengers.
The method should handle cases where the road network is empty or contains only the capital city. In such cases, it should return 0 as no fuel is required to reach the capital city.
The method should handle cases where there are multiple paths to reach the capital city and return the minimum fuel cost among them.
