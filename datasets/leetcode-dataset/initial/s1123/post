Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves_. **Explanation:** We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram. The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree. Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.
