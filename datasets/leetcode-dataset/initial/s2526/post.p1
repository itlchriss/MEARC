Preconditions:
- The method `consec` should be called after the `DataStream` object has been initialized with a value and k.
- The `value` and `k` parameters should be integers.

Postconditions:
- The method should return a boolean value indicating whether the last `k` integers in the stream are equal to `value`.
- If there are less than `k` integers in the stream, the method should return `false`.
