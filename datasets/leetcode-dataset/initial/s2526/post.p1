The `consec` function in the `dataStream` class adds the integer `num` to the stream. It returns `true` only if the last `k` integers in the stream are equal to `value`. Otherwise, the result is `false`. If there are fewer than `k` integers in the stream, the condition is not met, resulting in a return value of `false`.
