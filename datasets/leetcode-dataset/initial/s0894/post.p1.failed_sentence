The input to the function should be an integer `n`, where `n` represents the number of nodes in a binary tree.The list of all possible full binary trees with `n` nodes should be returned by the function.For every tree in the answer, it is required that each node of that tree has a value of 0.Each root node of one possible tree is an element of the answer, where the answer is a list of TreeNodes.The list of all possible full binary trees, which is the final result, can be returned in any order.
