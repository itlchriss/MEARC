You are given the `root` of a maximum binary tree and an integer `val`. Just as in the [previous problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/), the given tree was constructed from a list `a` (`root = Construct(a)`) recursively with the following `Construct(a)` routine: Note that we were not given `a` directly, only a root node `root = Construct(a)`.
