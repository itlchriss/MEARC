Given an array of integers `forbidden`, where `forbidden[i]` means that the bug cannot jump to the position `forbidden[i]`, and integers `a`, `b`, and `x`, return _the minimum number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home_. If there is no possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position `x`, return `-1.`
