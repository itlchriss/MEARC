If the bug is unable to land on position `x`, the minimum number of jumps needed to reach its home should be returned. The bug cannot jump to positions represented by the array of integers `forbidden[i]`. Additionally, the integers `a`, `b`, and `x` are provided. If it is possible for the bug to reach position `x`, the minimum number of jumps required should be calculated. If it is not possible for the bug to land on position `x`, the function should return `-1`.
