Preconditions:
The method should take in three parameters: `s` (the initial string), `t` (the target string), and `k` (the maximum number of moves allowed).
The strings `s` and `t` should not be null.
The value of `k` should be a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
The method should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to convert `s` into `t` in no more than `k` moves.
If it is possible to convert `s` into `t` in no more than `k` moves, the method should return `true`.
If it is not possible to convert `s` into `t` in no more than `k` moves, the method should return `false`.
