The function `f` should have two string parameters: `prefix` and `suffix`, and it should be a part of the system.The index of a word in the dictionary that has the given `prefix` and `suffix` should be returned by the function `f`.If there are multiple words in the dictionary that match both the given `prefix` and `suffix`, the function should return the highest index among those words.If the given `prefix` and `suffix` do not match any word in the dictionary, the function should return -The system should have a function named `wordFilter . f` that takes two string parameters: `prefix` and `suffix` .The index of a word in the dictionary that has the specified `prefix` and `suffix` should be returned by the function `wordFilter . f`.If there are multiple words in the dictionary that match both the given `prefix` and `suffix`, the function should return the highest index among those words.If the dictionary does not contain any word that matches both the given `prefix` and `suffix`, the function should return -1.
