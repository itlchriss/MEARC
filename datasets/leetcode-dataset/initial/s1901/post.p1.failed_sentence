The `m x n` matrix `mat` is a 0-indexed matrix.The matrix `mat` does not have any adjacent cells that are equal.The objective is to locate any peak element within the matrix `mat`, where the matrix is the parameter array.The element at position `i` and `j` in the matrix represents the peak element.The array `[i ,  j]` representing the coordinates of the peak element should be the output, and it should have a length of 2.
