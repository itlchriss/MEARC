To find the greatest English letter that occurs as both a lowercase and uppercase letter in a given string `s`, the algorithm should iterate through each character in `s`. The algorithm should compare each character to the current greatest letter found so far, keeping track of the greatest letter that satisfies the condition. The algorithm should consider only uppercase and lowercase English letters.

If no such letter is found, the algorithm should return an empty string.

The resulting letter should be in uppercase.
