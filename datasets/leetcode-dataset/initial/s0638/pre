You are given an integer array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item, and an integer array `needs` where `needs[i]` is the number of pieces of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item you want to buy. You are also given an array `special` where `special[i]` is of size `n + 1` where `special[i][j]` is the number of pieces of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> item in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> offer and `special[i][n]` (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> offer. Return _the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers_. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.
