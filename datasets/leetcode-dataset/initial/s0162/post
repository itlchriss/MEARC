Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**. **Explanation:** 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2. **Explanation:** Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
