Preconditions:
The input integer n must be a positive integer.

Postconditions:
The method should return true if the binary representation of n has alternating bits, i.e., if two adjacent bits always have different values.
The method should return false if the binary representation of n does not have alternating bits, i.e., if two adjacent bits have the same value.
