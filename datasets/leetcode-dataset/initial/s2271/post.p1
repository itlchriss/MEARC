Preconditions:
The method should take in a 2D array of integers named "tiles" as a parameter.
The "tiles" array should represent a grid of tiles, where each tile is either white or not white.
The method should take in an integer named "carpetLength" as a parameter.
The "carpetLength" parameter should represent the length of the carpet that will be used to cover the tiles.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
If the "tiles" array is empty or null, the method should return If the "carpetLength" parameter is less than or equal to 0, the method should return If the "carpetLength" parameter is greater than the total number of tiles in the "tiles" array, the method should return the total number of white tiles in the "tiles" array.
If the "carpetLength" parameter is equal to the total number of tiles in the "tiles" array, the method should return the total number of white tiles in the "tiles" array.
If the "carpetLength" parameter is less than the total number of tiles in the "tiles" array, the method should return the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
