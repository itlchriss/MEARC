You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` specialty retail stores. There are `m` product types of varying amounts, which are given as a **0-indexed** integer array `quantities`, where `quantities[i]` represents the number of products of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> product type. initial prepare.sh run.sh A store can only be given **at most one product type** but can be given **any** amount of it. initial prepare.sh run.sh After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly `0`). Let `x` represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want `x` to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to **minimize** the **maximum** number of products that are given to any store. The maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3. The maximum number of products given to any store is max(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5. The maximum number of products given to any store is max(100000) = 100000.
