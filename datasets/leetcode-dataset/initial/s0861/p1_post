The method should return an integer value representing the highest possible score.
The score should be calculated based on the given grid and any number of moves made.
The grid may be modified during the calculation of the score.
The original grid should not be modified after the method execution.
The score should be calculated according to the following rules:
- Initially, all elements in the grid are either 0 or   - The score is calculated by summing up the decimal value of each row in the grid.
- The decimal value of a row is calculated by converting the binary representation of the row into a decimal number.
- The binary representation of a row is obtained by concatenating the binary representation of each element in the row.
- The binary representation of an element is obtained by converting the element into a binary string.
- During the calculation of the score, any number of moves can be made.
- A move is defined as flipping either the entire row or the entire column of the grid.
- Flipping a row means changing all the elements in the row from 0 to 1 or from 1 to   - Flipping a column means changing all the elements in the column from 0 to 1 or from 1 to   - After each move, the score should be recalculated based on the modified grid.
- The goal is to maximize the score by making the optimal number of moves.
