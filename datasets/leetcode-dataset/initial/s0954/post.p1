Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` must not be null.
- The length of the input array `arr` must be even.

Postconditions:
- The method should return `true` if it is possible to reorder the array `arr` such that `arr[2*i + 1] = 2 * arr[2*i]` for every `0 <= i < len(arr) / 2`.
- The method should return `false` if it is not possible to reorder the array `arr` as described above.
