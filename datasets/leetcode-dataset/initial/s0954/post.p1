The length of the input integer array should be even, and the function should return a boolean value.The objective of this function is to assess the possibility of rearranging the provided array in such a way that `arr[2i + 1]` is equal to `arr[2i]` for every `0 <= i < len(arr) / 2`.If it is possible to reorder the array as described in requirement 2, the function should return `true`. However, if it is not possible to reorder the array as described in requirement 2, the function should return `false`.
