The method returns an integer value representing the minimum number of flips required to make `a` OR `b` equal to `c`.
The bits in `a` and `b` are flipped only if necessary to make `a` OR `b` equal to `c`.
The original values of `a` and `b` are not modified.
The method does not modify any other variables or objects outside its scope.
The method handles all possible combinations of bits in `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine the minimum number of flips required.
