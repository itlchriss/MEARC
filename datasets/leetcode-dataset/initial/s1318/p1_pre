The method `minFlips` takes three positive numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
The numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers.
The numbers `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
The numbers `a` and `b` have the same number of bits.
The number of bits in `c` is less than or equal to the number of bits in `a` and `b`.
