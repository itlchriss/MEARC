Preconditions:
The method `minFlips` takes three positive numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
The numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers.
The numbers `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
The numbers `a` and `b` have the same number of bits.
The number of bits in `c` is less than or equal to the number of bits in `a` and `b`.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the minimum number of flips required to make `a` OR `b` equal to `c`.
The bits in `a` and `b` are flipped only if necessary to make `a` OR `b` equal to `c`.
The original values of `a` and `b` are not modified.
The method does not modify any other variables or objects outside its scope.
The method handles all possible combinations of bits in `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine the minimum number of flips required.
