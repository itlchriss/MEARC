The input for the system should consist of three positive numbers, namely `a`, `b`, and `c`. The system should then execute the following operations.Performing a bitwise OR operation on `a` and `b` and comparing the resulting value with `c` should be done by the system.After comparing the result of the bitwise OR operation between the parameters `a` and `b` with the parameter `c`, the system should determine the number of bits that need to be flipped in the parameters `a` and `b` in order to make the result equal to the parameter `c`.The necessary calculations should be performed by the system in order to achieve the desired result of calculating the minimum number of flips required, given the parameters of the method public static int csb(int n) and public int minFlips(int a, int b, int c), where the result is not null.The minimum number of flips needed to achieve the desired result should ultimately be returned by the system.
