Preconditions:
The method `minFlips` takes three positive integer inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`.
The inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive numbers.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the minimum number of flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make `(a OR b) == c`.
The returned value is non-negative.
The returned value is the minimum possible number of flips required to achieve the desired condition.
The bits of `a` and `b` that need to be flipped are determined based on the condition `(a OR b) == c`.
The original values of `a` and `b` are not modified by the method.
The method does not have any side effects.
