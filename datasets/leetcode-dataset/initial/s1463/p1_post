The method should return an integer value representing the maximum number of cherries that can be collected using both robots.
The input grid should remain unchanged after the method is executed.
The positions of the robots in the grid should be updated according to the rules below.
The cherries that are collected by the robots should be removed from the grid.
Additional behavioural requirements:
The robots can only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
The robots can only move to adjacent cells in the grid.
The robots cannot move to cells that are outside the boundaries of the grid.
The robots cannot move to cells that are blocked by obstacles (represented by 0s).
If both robots try to move to the same cell, only one of them can collect the cherry.
If a robot collects a cherry, it can continue moving to another cell in the next step.
The robots can start at any position in the grid.
The robots can move independently of each other.
The robots cannot move diagonally.
The robots cannot move back to a cell they have already visited.
The robots cannot move to a cell that has already been visited by the other robot.
