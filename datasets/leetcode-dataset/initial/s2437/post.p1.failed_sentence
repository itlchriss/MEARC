The output of the system should strictly be an integer value when the parameter "time" is passed to it.The countTime method should calculate the number of valid clock times, where the time parameter is a string representing a time.The method public int countTime(String time) should replace every str_? in the parameter array with a digit from 0 to 9. The method should consider all possible combinations of digits to replace "?" in order to strictly adhere to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."All valid clock times that can be created should be considered by the system.The count of valid clock times should be determined by the system.The final answer should be the count of valid clock times returned by the system, given the parameter "time".
