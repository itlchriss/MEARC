The 2D integer array `dig` represents the input where each element signifies a cell to be excavated.The array `dig` consists of pairs of integers `[r, c]`, where each pair represents the row and column indices of a cell that needs to be excavated.The elements in the `dig` array are indexed starting from 0.The count of artifacts that can be extracted is the output.The colors represent the artifacts.In the grid, cells that have been excavated are marked with a 'D'.If all parts of an artifact are uncovered (labeled with a 'D'), it is possible to extract the artifact.If the array of artifacts is not fully excavated, the extraction of any part of it is not possible.The output returns the number of artifacts that can be extracted when the parameters n, artifacts, and dig are provided.
