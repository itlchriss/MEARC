Preconditions:
- The input integer `n` represents the size of the 2D array `dig`.
- The input 2D array `artifacts` represents the locations of artifacts in the grid.
- The input 2D array `dig` represents the cells that will be excavated.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the number of artifacts that can be extracted.
- The cells in the `dig` array that correspond to excavated cells are labeled with a 'D'.
- The artifacts that can be extracted are determined by checking if all parts of the artifact are uncovered (labeled with a 'D') in the `dig` array.
