The method should return an integer value representing the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring inside the input string `s`.
If there are no semi-repetitive substrings in the input string `s`, the method should return The method should handle both uppercase and lowercase characters in the input string `s`.
The method should consider a substring as semi-repetitive if it contains at least one repeated character and all other characters are unique.
The method should consider a substring as semi-repetitive even if the repeated characters are not adjacent to each other.
The method should consider a substring as semi-repetitive even if there are other repeated characters in the substring.
The method should consider a substring as semi-repetitive even if there are other non-repeated characters in the substring.
The method should consider a substring as semi-repetitive even if the repeated characters are in different cases (e.g., 'a' and 'A').
The method should return the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring, even if there are multiple substrings with the same length.
