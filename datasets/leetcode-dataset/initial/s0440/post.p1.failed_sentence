The input for the function consists of two integers, `n` and `k`, which should be taken as parameters.The integer value to be returned by the function should represent the result, which is not null.The lexicographically smallest integer in the range `[1 ,  n]` should be found by the function, where the function's parameters are `n` and `k`.The `kth` lexicographically smallest integer should be returned by the function, where the parameter `n` represents the total number of integers and the parameter `k` represents the position of the integer in the lexicographic order.The condition where the value of `n` is smaller than `k` should be handled by the function, and an appropriate result should be returned.The scenario of `n` being equal to `k` should be considered by the function, and it should provide a suitable outcome.The condition where the value of `n` is greater than the value of `k` should be handled by the function, and an appropriate result should be returned.The case of a negative number for `n` should be handled by the function, and an appropriate result should be returned.The case of a negative number for `k` should be handled by the function, and an appropriate result should be returned.The case of both `n` and `k` being negative numbers should be handled by the function, and an appropriate result should be returned.The case where `n` is zero should be handled by the function, and an appropriate result should be returned.The case where `k` is zero should be handled by the function, and an appropriate result should be returned.The scenario of both `n` and `k` being zero should be considered by the function, and it should provide a suitable outcome.The scenario of a large positive number for `n` should be considered by the function, and it should provide a suitable outcome.The case of a large positive number for `k` should be handled by the function, and an appropriate result should be returned.The scenario of having both `n` and `k` as large positive numbers should be considered by the function, and it should provide a suitable outcome.
