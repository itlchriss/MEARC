The Java method `shortestToChar` takes a string `s` and a character `c` as input. The method returns an array of integers `answer` where the length of `answer` is equal to the length of `s`. Each element `answer[i]` in the array represents the distance from the index `i` to the closest occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. The algorithm used in this method calculates the distance between each index and the closest occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`, and stores the distances in the `answer` array.
