The method should return a new matrix that is the result of flipping the input matrix horizontally and then inverting it.
The dimensions of the returned matrix should be the same as the input matrix `image` (n x n).
The elements of the returned matrix should be inverted versions of the corresponding elements in the input matrix `image`.
The input matrix `image` should remain unchanged after the method is executed.
