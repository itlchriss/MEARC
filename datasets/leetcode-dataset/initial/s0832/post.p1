Preconditions:
The input matrix `image` must not be null.
The input matrix `image` must be a square matrix of size `n x n`.
The elements of the input matrix `image` must be binary values (0 or 1).

Postconditions:
The method should return a new matrix that is the result of flipping the input matrix horizontally and then inverting it.
The dimensions of the returned matrix should be the same as the input matrix `image` (n x n).
The elements of the returned matrix should be inverted versions of the corresponding elements in the input matrix `image`.
The input matrix `image` should remain unchanged after the method is executed.
