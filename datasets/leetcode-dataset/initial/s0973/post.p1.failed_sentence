Given an array of points, represented as `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, where each point represents a coordinate on the X-Y plane, and an integer `k`, this method returns the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)` in any order. The result will be a unique array of points, excluding their order, with a guarantee.
