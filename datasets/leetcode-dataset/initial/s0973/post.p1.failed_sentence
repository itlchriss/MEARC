An input array of points should be accepted by the system.The array of points, which is represented as [x, y] coordinates, should have each point explicitly stated.Acceptance of an integer k as input should be ensured by the system.The calculation of the distance between each point and the origin (0, 0) on the X-Y plane should be performed by the system.The array of points should be identified by the system, and these points should have the shortest distance to the origin. The number of points to be identified should be specified by the parameter k.The array of points should be sorted in ascending order, and the system should return the k closest points to the origin.The order in which the k closest points are returned is not important, just like the result being not null and the parameter array being sorted in ascending order.The method should guarantee that the points returned by it are unique.The output should ensure that the order of the points in the result array is unique, when the input parameter array of points is passed to the method with the integer value of k.
