The lengths of strings `s` and `t` should be provided as inputs to the function, which takes two input strings.The minimum window substring of `s` that includes every character in `t` should be returned as a string.If the substring that satisfies the condition does not exist, the function should return an empty string `str_`.The consideration of both lowercase and uppercase characters as distinct, along with the inclusion of duplicate characters in `t`, should be taken into account by the function.The minimum window substring should be found by considering the order of characters in both `s` and `t`, while strictly adhering to the syntax of the given examples and using no pronouns.The handling of cases where `s` is an empty string should be included in addition to the handling of cases where `t` is an empty string.The case of both `s` and `t` being empty strings should be handled by the function.The condition to be handled by the method is when the characters in the parameter `s` and the parameter `t` are the same, but in different orders.The condition to be handled is when the characters in the parameter string `s` are the same as the characters in the parameter string `t` and are in the same order.The method should be able to handle scenarios where the characters in the parameter strings `s` and `t` are the same, but with varying frequencies.The condition to be handled is when the characters in the parameters `s` and `t` are different.The condition to be handled is when the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are different.The case where `s` and `t` have the same length should be handled by the function.The scenario to be handled by the function is when the lengths and characters of the parameters `s` and `t` differ.The condition to be handled by the method is when the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are different, and there are some common characters between them.The case where the lengths of `s` and `t` are different and there are no common characters should be handled by the function.The condition for the function is that the lengths of `s` and `t` are different, and all characters in `t` are present in `s`.The method should be able to handle scenarios where the lengths of the parameters `s` and `t` are different, as well as situations where certain characters in `t` are found in `s`.The scenario to be handled by the function is when the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are different and there are no characters in string `t` that are present in string `s`.
