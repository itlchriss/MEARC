Given `students` and `mentors`, return _the **maximum compatibility score sum** that can be achieved._
The survey was given to `m` students numbered from `0` to `m - 1` and `m` mentors numbered from `0` to `m - 1`. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array `students` where `students[i]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student (**0-indexed**). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array `mentors` where `mentors[j]` is an integer array that contains the answers of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> mentor (**0-indexed**).
