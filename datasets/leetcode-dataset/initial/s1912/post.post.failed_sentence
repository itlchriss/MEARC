You have a movie renting company consisting of `n` shops. You want to implement a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies. The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies. initial prepare.sh run.sh **Search**: Finds the **cheapest 5 shops** that have an **unrented copy** of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by **price** in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the **smaller** <code>shop<sub>i</sub></code> should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned. initial prepare.sh run.sh **Report**: Returns the **cheapest 5 rented movies** (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list `res` where <code>res[j] = [shop<sub>j</sub>, movie<sub>j</sub>]</code> describes that the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> cheapest rented movie <code>movie<sub>j</sub></code> was rented from the shop <code>shop<sub>j</sub></code>. The movies in `res` should be sorted by **price** in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the **smaller** <code>shop<sub>j</sub></code> should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the **smaller** <code>movie<sub>j</sub></code> should appear first. If there are fewer than 5 rented movies, then all of them should be returned. If no movies are currently being rented, then an empty list should be returned. **Explanation:** MovieRentingSystem movieRentingSystem = new MovieRentingSystem(3, [[0, 1, 5], [0, 2, 6], [0, 3, 7], [1, 1, 4], [1, 2, 7], [2, 1, 5]]); movieRentingSystem.search(1); // return [1, 0, 2], Movies of ID 1 are unrented at shops 1, 0, and 2. Shop 1 is cheapest; shop 0 and 2 are the same price, so order by shop number. movieRentingSystem.rent(0, 1); // Rent movie 1 from shop 0. Unrented movies at shop 0 are now [2,3]. movieRentingSystem.rent(1, 2); // Rent movie 2 from shop 1. Unrented movies at shop 1 are now [1]. movieRentingSystem.report(); // return [[0, 1], [1, 2]]. Movie 1 from shop 0 is cheapest, followed by movie 2 from shop 1. movieRentingSystem.drop(1, 2); // Drop off movie 2 at shop 1. Unrented movies at shop 1 are now [1,2]. movieRentingSystem.search(2); // return [0, 1]. Movies of ID 2 are unrented at shops 0 and 1. Shop 0 is cheapest, followed by shop 1.
