The condition for the input is that it should be a binary tree and it should meet the condition of being a binary tree.The expected outcome is the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree, with the additional condition that the sub-tree must also be a Binary Search Tree (BST).All values in the binary tree are negatives, and there are no positive values in the parameter array.If there are no valid sub-trees that are also Binary Search Trees (BSTs), the output should be a BST that is empty.
