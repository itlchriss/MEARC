To find the maximum sum of all keys in a sub-tree that is a Binary Search Tree (BST), the Java method `maxSumBST` takes a `TreeNode` object named `root` as input. The method returns an integer value representing the sum. If the BST is empty, meaning all values are negatives, the method returns an empty BST.
