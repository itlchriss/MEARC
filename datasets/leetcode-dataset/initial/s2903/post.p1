Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` has at least two elements.
- The input integer `indexDifference` is non-negative.
- The input integer `valueDifference` is non-negative.

Postconditions:
- The returned integer array `answer` is not null.
- The length of the returned integer array `answer` is - If there are two indices `i` and `j` in the input array `nums` such that `nums[i] - nums[j] = valueDifference` and `i - j = indexDifference`, then `answer[0] = i` and `answer[1] = j`.
- If there are no two indices `i` and `j` in the input array `nums` that satisfy the conditions, then `answer[0] = -1` and `answer[1] = -1`.
- If there are multiple choices for the two indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions, then any valid choice can be returned.
