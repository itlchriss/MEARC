If the given Java method `findIndices` is unable to find two indices that satisfy the conditions of having a difference of `indexDifference` and a difference of `valueDifference` between the elements in the `nums` array, it will return an integer array `answer` with the values [-1, -1]. However, if the method is able to find two such indices, it will return an integer array `answer` with the values [i, j], where i and j are any valid indices that meet the given conditions.
