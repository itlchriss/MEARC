Return _an integer array_ `answer`, _where_ `answer = [i, j]` _if there are two such indices_, _and_ `answer = [-1, -1]` _otherwise_. If there are multiple choices for the two indices, return _any of them_. **Explanation:** In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to find two indices that satisfy both conditions. Hence, [-1,-1] is returned.
