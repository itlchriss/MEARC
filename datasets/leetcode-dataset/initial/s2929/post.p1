Preconditions:
The method should take two parameters: `n` (the total number of candies) and `k` (the limit of candies per child).
The value of `n` should be a non-negative integer.
The value of `k` should be a positive integer.

Postconditions:
The method should return a long value representing the total number of ways to distribute the candies.
The returned value should be a non-negative integer.
The returned value should be less than or equal to the total number of ways to distribute `n` candies among 3 children without any limit.
Each child should receive a number of candies less than or equal to the limit `k`.
The distribution of candies should be such that no child receives more than the limit `k` candies.
The distribution of candies should be such that the total number of candies distributed is equal to `n`.
