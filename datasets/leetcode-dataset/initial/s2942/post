**Note** that the returned array may be in **any** order. **Explanation:** "e" occurs in both words: "l**<ins>ee</ins>**t", and "cod<ins>**e**</ins>". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1. **Explanation:** "a" occurs in "**<ins>a</ins>**bc", and "<ins>**aaaa**</ins>". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2. **Explanation:** "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
Return _an **array of indices** representing the words that contain the character_ `x`.
