Preconditions:
The arrays `cost` and `time` must have the same length.
The arrays `cost` and `time` must not be empty.
The elements in the `cost` array must be non-negative integers.
The elements in the `time` array must be positive integers.
The length of the arrays `cost` and `time` must be greater than or equal to `n`.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer representing the minimum amount of money required to paint `n` walls.
The returned value is non-negative.
The returned value is the minimum possible cost to paint `n` walls based on the given `cost` and `time` arrays.
