The comparison of two string arrays, `word1` and `word2`, should be performed by the system.The condition to be determined is whether the two arrays, word1 and word2, represent the same string.If the arrays word1 and word2 represent the same string, the method should return `true`.If the arrays word1 and word2 do not represent the same string, the method should return `false`.The strings should be considered the same if they contain the same characters in the same order, as is the case with the parameter arrays being sorted in ascending order.The strings should be considered different if they contain different characters or if the characters are arranged in a different order, when the arrays word1 and word2 are passed as parameters to the method.
