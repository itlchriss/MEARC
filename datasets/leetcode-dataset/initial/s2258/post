Return _the **maximum** number of minutes that you can stay in your initial position before moving while still safely reaching the safehouse_. If this is impossible, return `-1`. If you can **always** reach the safehouse regardless of the minutes stayed, return <code>10<sup>9</sup></code>. Thus, -1 is returned. **Explanation:** The figure above shows the initial grid. Notice that the fire is contained by walls and you will always be able to safely reach the safehouse. Thus, 10<sup>9</sup> is returned.
