The input grid is a 2D array of integers.
The grid represents a map where each cell can be either empty, a wall, or on fire.
The safehouse is represented by a specific cell in the grid.
The initial position of the player is also represented by a specific cell in the grid.
The player can only move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are not walls or on fire.
