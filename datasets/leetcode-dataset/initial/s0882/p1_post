The method returns an integer representing the number of nodes that are reachable from node 0 in the new graph.
The new graph is formed by removing any edges that require more than `maxMoves` moves to traverse.
The new graph may have additional nodes compared to the original graph if there are nodes that can be reached within `maxMoves` moves but were not directly connected to node 0 in the original graph.
The new graph may have fewer nodes compared to the original graph if there are nodes that cannot be reached within `maxMoves` moves from node The new graph maintains the undirected property, meaning that if there is an edge between node A and node B in the new graph, there is also an edge between node B and node A.
