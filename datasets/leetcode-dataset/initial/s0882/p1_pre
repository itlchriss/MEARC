The input graph `edges` is a 2D array representing the edges between nodes in the original graph.
The input `maxMoves` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of moves allowed.
The input `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of nodes in the graph.
The graph is undirected, meaning that if there is an edge between node A and node B, there is also an edge between node B and node A.
