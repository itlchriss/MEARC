You are given an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `cost` of length `n`, where `cost[i]` is the **cost** assigned to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node.
