The method should return `true` if the binary tree is Even-Odd.
The method should return `false` if the binary tree is not Even-Odd.
If the binary tree is empty (i.e., no root node), the method should return `false`.
If the binary tree has only one node, the method should return `true`.
The binary tree should have alternating levels where the nodes at even levels have odd values and the nodes at odd levels have even values.
The values of the nodes at even levels should be strictly increasing from left to right.
The values of the nodes at odd levels should be strictly decreasing from left to right.
The binary tree should not have any nodes with the same value at the same level.
The binary tree should not have any nodes with values that violate the even-odd pattern at their respective levels.
