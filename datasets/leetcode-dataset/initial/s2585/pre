There is a test that has `n` types of questions. You are given an integer `target` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `types` where <code>types[i] = [count<sub>i</sub>, marks<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there are <code>count<sub>i</sub></code> questions of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> type, and each one of them is worth <code>marks<sub>i</sub></code> points.
