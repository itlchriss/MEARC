To calculate the area of the largest triangle that can be formed on the X-Y plane, the algorithm takes an array `points` as input. This array contains three different points represented as [xi, yi]. The algorithm then determines the area of the largest triangle that can be formed using these points. The result is returned as a double value. The calculated area should be within 10^-5 of the actual answer.
