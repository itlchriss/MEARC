The method returns an integer value representing the minimum maximum difference among all `p` pairs.
The maximum difference is calculated by taking the absolute difference between two elements in the array and finding the maximum difference among all pairs.
If the input array `nums` is empty, the method returns 0 as the maximum difference.
