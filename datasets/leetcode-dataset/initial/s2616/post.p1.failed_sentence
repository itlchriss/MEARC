The minimum difference that is the maximum among all pairs should be returned by the function, given that the parameter array nums is sorted in ascending order and the parameter p is used.The absolute difference between two elements in the nums array determines the maximum difference, which is calculated by the method public int minimizeMax when the parameters nums and p are provided.The absolute differences between nums[1] and nums[4] and the absolute differences between nums[2] and nums[5] determine the maximum difference, which is minimized by comparing them.The larger value between |the difference of the second and fifth elements of the nums array| and |the difference of the third and sixth elements of the nums array| calculates the maximum difference.In order to ascertain the ultimate outcome, the maximum disparity is compared to zero, taking into account the sorted ascending order of the array parameter.In the scenario where the array of parameters, nums, is sorted in ascending order and the value of p is greater than zero, the expected outcome is for the function to return the maximum difference.If the maximum difference between the elements in the parameter array, nums, is zero, then the result should be zero.The condition is established that when the array of integers, nums, is empty, the maximum value is defined as zero.
