You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing a **0-indexed** `m x n` grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays `guards` and `walls` where <code>guards[i] = [row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>]</code> and <code>walls[j] = [row<sub>j</sub>, col<sub>j</sub>]</code> represent the positions of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> guard and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> wall respectively.
