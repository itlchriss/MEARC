**Explanation:** At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off]. After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on]. After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on]. After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.
Return _the number of bulbs that are on after `n` rounds_.
