Preconditions:
- The method `public OrderedStream(int n)` is called before calling the `insert` method.
- The parameter `n` in the `OrderedStream` constructor is a positive integer representing the maximum number of elements in the stream.

Postconditions:
- The `insert` method inserts a pair `(idKey, value)` into the stream.
- The `insert` method returns the largest possible chunk of currently inserted values that appear next in the order.
- The returned chunk is a list of strings.
- The values in the returned chunk are in increasing order of their IDs.
- The concatenation of all the returned chunks will result in a list of the sorted values.
