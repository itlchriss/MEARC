The `insert` method inserts a pair `(idKey, value)` into the stream.
The `insert` method returns the largest possible chunk of currently inserted values that appear next in the order.
The returned chunk is a list of strings.
The values in the returned chunk are in increasing order of their IDs.
The concatenation of all the returned chunks will result in a list of the sorted values.
