The array of integers, representing the output, should not be null.The size of the resulting array must match the size of the input array `queries`, just like the length of the parameter array is required to be in ascending order.The answer array should contain an element for each query in the input array, where each element corresponds to the answer of the corresponding query.The arrangement of the elements in the output array should correspond to the arrangement of the queries in the input array, similar to how the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.
