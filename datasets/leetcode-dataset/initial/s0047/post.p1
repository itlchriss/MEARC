- The order of the permutations in the returned list is not specified.
- Each permutation in the returned list is unique, meaning there are no duplicate permutations.
- Each permutation in the returned list contains all the numbers from the input array `nums`.
- The length of each permutation in the returned list is equal to the length of the input array `nums`.
