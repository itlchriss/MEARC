Preconditions:
The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
The input `edges` is a 2D array representing the edges of the tree, where each element is an array of size 2 containing two integers representing the vertices connected by the edge.
The input `hasApple` is a list of size `n` containing boolean values, where `hasApple[i]` represents whether vertex `i` has an apple or not.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer representing the minimum time in seconds required to collect all the apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.
