You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `mapping` which represents the mapping rule of a shuffled decimal system. `mapping[i] = j` means digit `i` should be mapped to digit `j` in this system. You are also given another integer array `nums`. Return _the array_ `nums` _sorted in **non-decreasing** order based on the **mapped values** of its elements._
