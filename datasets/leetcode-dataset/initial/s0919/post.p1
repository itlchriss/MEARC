The `insert` function in `CBTInserter` initially inserts a `TreeNode` with the value `val` into the tree in order to maintain the completeness of the tree. Afterward, the result is the value of the parent of the inserted `TreeNode`. The `getRoot` function in `CBTInserter` solely returns the root node of the tree. It is important to note that the `getRoot` function does not have any other functionality and it does not modify the tree in any way.
