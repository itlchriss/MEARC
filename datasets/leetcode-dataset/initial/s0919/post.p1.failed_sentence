The `prepare . sh` script must be executed before any other scripts, ensuring that the system is properly set up.Upon completion of the execution of the `prepare.sh` script, the system should possess a `run.sh` script that necessitates execution.To perform the insertion of a `TreeNode` with a value equal to `val` into the tree, it is necessary for the system to possess a function `insert(int v)`.When the `TreeNode` is inserted, the complete tree should remain intact.The returned value of the `insert` function should be the value of the parent of the `TreeNode` that was inserted.The function `get_root()` should be present in the system and it should return the root node of the tree.The list of values representing the nodes in the tree should be returned by the `get_root` function in a specific order.
