The minimum cost required to reach the top of the floor should be calculated by the system.In order to determine the minimum cost, all possible paths should be considered by the system, with the parameter array being sorted in ascending order.Taking into account the cost associated with each step or movement, the calculation should consider it as a factor, ensuring that the result is not null. Additionally, the parameter array should be sorted in ascending order.Treating the top of the floor as the ultimate goal, the final destination should be identified by the system.The output, presented as the final result, should be the minimum cost provided by the system, ensuring that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The calculation of the minimum cost should not consider any unnecessary or redundant movements, while the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The capability of handling different floor layouts and configurations, and adapting to various scenarios, should be present in the system.The cost values associated with each step or movement should be handled by the system, while also accommodating varying expenses.The capability to manage various starting points on the floor should be possessed by the system, thereby permitting flexibility in the initial position.Taking into account different obstacles or barriers on the floor that may have an impact on the cost calculation, the cost calculation process should be able to handle them.
