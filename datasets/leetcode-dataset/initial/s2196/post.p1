Preconditions:
The `descriptions` parameter must not be null.
The `descriptions` parameter must be a 2D array.
Each element in the `descriptions` array must be an array of size 2, representing a node in the binary tree.
The first element of each node array must be an integer representing the value of the node.
The second element of each node array must be an integer representing the index of the parent node in the `descriptions` array.
The parent node index must be a valid index in the `descriptions` array.
The root node index must be 
Postconditions:
The method should return the root node of the constructed binary tree.
The binary tree should be constructed according to the descriptions provided in the `descriptions` array.
Each node in the binary tree should have a value equal to the first element of its corresponding array in the `descriptions` array.
Each node in the binary tree should have a parent node whose index is equal to the second element of its corresponding array in the `descriptions` array.
The root node should have a parent node index of -1, indicating that it is the root of the binary tree.
