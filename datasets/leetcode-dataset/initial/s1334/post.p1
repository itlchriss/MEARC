Preconditions:
- The input integer `n` represents the total number of cities.
- The input 2D array `edges` represents the connections between cities, where `edges[i][0]` and `edges[i][1]` are two cities connected by an edge.
- The input integer `maxDist` represents the maximum distance threshold for a city to be considered reachable.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the city with the smallest number of reachable cities within the distance threshold, and if there are multiple cities with the same number of reachable cities, it returns the city with the greatest number.
