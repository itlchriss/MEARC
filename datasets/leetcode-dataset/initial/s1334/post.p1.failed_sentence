Find and return the city from the given `n` cities, represented by the `edges` array, that has the smallest number of cities reachable through a path with a distance at most `maxDist`. If there are multiple cities with the same smallest number, return the city with the greatest number. For example, if cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities within a distance of `maxDist`, city 3 should be returned as it has the greatest number of reachable cities.
