Preconditions:
The input parameter `costs` is a 2D array of integers representing the cost of flying each person from one city to another.
The number of rows in `costs` is equal to twice the value of `n`, where `n` is the number of people arriving in each city.
The number of columns in `costs` is equal to 2, representing the two cities.
The values in `costs` are non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer representing the minimum cost to fly every person to a city.
The minimum cost is calculated such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city.
The minimum cost is determined by selecting the optimal combination of people to be flown to each city, considering the cost of flying each person.
The method does not modify the input parameter `costs`.
