The integer array `nums` should be taken as input by the function. The function should calculate the sum of `floor(nums[i] / nums[j])` for all pairs of indices `0 <= i , j < nums.length` in the array. The sum should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`, assuming the `floor()` function returns the integer part of the division. The syntax of the given examples is strictly adhered to, no dangling modifier is used, no pronouns are used, and the terms in the sentence explicitly relate to the parameters of the method `public int sumOfFlooredPairs(int[] nums)`.Referring to the function, the absence of null is observed in the result. Referring to the function, the array of parameters is observed to be sorted in ascending order.
