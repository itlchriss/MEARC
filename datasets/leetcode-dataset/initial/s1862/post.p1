The method `sumOfFlooredPairs` takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns the sum of the floor division of each pair of elements in the array. The floor division is obtained by dividing `nums[i]` by `nums[j]` for all pairs of indices `i` and `j` where `0 <= i, j < nums.length`. The result is then calculated modulo `10^9 + 7` to avoid an excessively large answer.
