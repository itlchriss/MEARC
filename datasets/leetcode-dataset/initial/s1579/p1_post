The method `maxNumEdgesToRemove` returns an integer representing the maximum number of edges that can be removed from the graph.
If it is impossible for the graph to be fully traversed by Alice and Bob, the method returns -The method `union` takes four parameters: two integers `x` and `y` representing the nodes to be connected, and two integer arrays `arr` and `rank` representing the disjoint set data structure.
The `arr` array represents the parent of each node in the disjoint set.
The `rank` array represents the rank of each node in the disjoint set.
The method `union` returns a boolean value indicating whether the union operation was successful.
The method `find` takes two parameters: an integer `x` representing the node to find, and an integer array `arr` representing the disjoint set data structure.
The `arr` array represents the parent of each node in the disjoint set.
The method `find` returns an integer representing the root of the set that contains the given node.
