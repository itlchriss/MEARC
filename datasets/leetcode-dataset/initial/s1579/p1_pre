The method `maxNumEdgesToRemove` takes two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the graph, and a 2D integer array `edges` representing the edges between the nodes.
The `edges` array contains valid edges, where each edge is represented by a pair of integers (x, y) indicating a connection between node x and node y.
The `edges` array is not null and has at least one element.
The values of `n` and the nodes in the `edges` array are within the valid range.
