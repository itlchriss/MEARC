Given an array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [type<sub>i</sub>, u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a bidirectional edge of type <code>type<sub>i</sub></code> between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.
