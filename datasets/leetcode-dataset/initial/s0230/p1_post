The method returns an integer value.
The returned value is the kth smallest value in the binary search tree.
The returned value is the kth smallest value among all the values of the nodes in the tree.
The returned value is 1-indexed, meaning the smallest value is at index 1, the second smallest value is at index 2, and so on.
If the binary search tree has less than k nodes, the method returns -1 or throws an exception to indicate that the kth smallest value does not exist.
