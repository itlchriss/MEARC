Accepting an integer `n` as input, the algorithm should also accept an array of unique integers `blacklist` sorted in ascending order.The range `[0 ,  n - 1]` should be returned by the algorithm as a random integer. This integer should not be present in the `blacklist` array.The integer returned by the method should have an equal probability of being any integer in the range `[0, n - 1]` that is not included in the `blacklist` parameter array.The method `pick()` should have a parameter `n` which represents the range of integers from which a random integer should be obtained. The method should also have a parameter `blacklist` which represents an array of integers that should not be included in the random selection. The result of the method should be an integer that is not present in the `blacklist` array.In the example provided, it is required that every call of the `pick()` method returns integers in the range `[0, n - 1]` with an equal probability of 1/4. These integers should not be present in the `blacklist` parameter, which is an array sorted in ascending order.The condition where `n` is 0 or a negative number should be handled by the algorithm.The condition should be able to handle scenarios where the `blacklist` array is empty.The condition where the `blacklist` array includes all the integers in the range `[0 ,  n - 1]` should be handled by the algorithm.The algorithm should be capable of handling scenarios in which the `blacklist` array contains duplicate integers, similar to how the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The range `[0, n - 1]` should be able to handle cases where integers outside of it are contained in the `blacklist` array.The condition should be able to handle scenarios where the size of the `blacklist` array exceeds the value of `n`.The algorithm must handle cases where the `blacklist` array is not sorted in ascending order, similar to how the parameter array in the method is sorted in ascending order.The algorithm should be capable of handling scenarios in which the `blacklist` parameter is not an array of integers.The algorithm should be capable of handling scenarios where the value of `n` is not an integer.The condition where `n` is not a positive integer should be handled by the algorithm.
