You are given an integer `n` and an array of **unique** integers `blacklist`. Design an algorithm to pick a random integer in the range `[0, n - 1]` that is **not** in `blacklist`. Any integer that is in the mentioned range and not in `blacklist` should be **equally likely** to be returned. solution.pick(); // return 0, any integer from [0,1,4,6] should be ok. Note that for every call of pick, // 0, 1, 4, and 6 must be equally likely to be returned (i.e., with probability 1/4). solution.pick(); // return 4 solution.pick(); // return 1 solution.pick(); // return 6 solution.pick(); // return 1 solution.pick(); // return 0 solution.pick(); // return 4
initial prepare.sh run.sh `int pick()` Returns a random integer in the range `[0, n - 1]` and not in `blacklist`.
