The method returns an integer value representing the maximum number of non-empty non-overlapping subarrays.
The sum of values in each subarray is equal to the input integer `target`.
The subarrays are non-overlapping, meaning no two subarrays share any common elements.
The subarrays are non-empty, meaning each subarray contains at least one element.
The order of the subarrays in the input array `nums` is maintained in the output.
If there are no subarrays that satisfy the conditions, the method returns 0.
