Preconditions:
The method should take two integer parameters: mainTank and additionalTank.
The mainTank parameter should represent the capacity of the main fuel tank in liters.
The additionalTank parameter should represent the capacity of an additional fuel tank in liters.
The mainTank and additionalTank parameters should be non-negative integers.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the maximum distance that can be traveled.
The maximum distance should be calculated based on the total fuel capacity of both the mainTank and additionalTank.
The maximum distance should be calculated using a predetermined formula or algorithm.
The returned maximum distance value should be a non-negative integer.
