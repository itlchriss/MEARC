The integer array `nums` represents the input.The maximum width of a ramp in the `nums` array is the output.If the array `nums` does not contain a ramp, the output should be a subarray of `nums` where the elements are in non-decreasing order.The difference between the indices of the first and last elements of the parameter array represents the width of a ramp.The width of the ramp with the greatest value difference between its elements should be returned.
