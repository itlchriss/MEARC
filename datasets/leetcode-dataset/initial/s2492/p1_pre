The method should take two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of cities and a 2D integer array `roads` representing the connections between cities.
The value of `n` should be greater than or equal to The value of `roads` should be a non-empty array.
The cities should be numbered from 1 to `n`.
The connections between cities should be represented in the `roads` array as pairs of integers, where each pair represents a road between two cities.
