The input should consist of an array of integers, where the array is taken as a parameter.The input for the system should consist of two integers, denoted as `k` and `threshold`, which will be used as parameters.The calculation of the number of sub-arrays of size `k` should be performed by the system.The average of each sub-array should be calculated by the system.The average of each sub-array should be compared by the system with the threshold value.The count of sub-arrays with an average greater than or equal to the threshold should be determined by the system, using the parameter array, which is an integer array, the parameter k, which is an integer, and the parameter threshold, which is also an integer.The count of sub-arrays that meet the condition mentioned above should be returned by the system.
