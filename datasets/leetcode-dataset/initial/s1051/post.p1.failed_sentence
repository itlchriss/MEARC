The comparison should be made by the system between each element of the array "str_heights" and the corresponding element of the array "expected".The count of indices should be determined by the system, where the element in the array "str_heights" is not equal to the element in the array "expected".The count of indices where the elements in the array str_heights are not equal to the elements in the array "expected" should be returned by the system.
