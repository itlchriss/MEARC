The calculation of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1) should be performed by the system, ensuring that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The maximum value among F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1) should be determined by the system, ensuring that it strictly adheres to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." The terms F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1) should be explicitly related to the parameters of the method public int maxRotateFunction(int[] nums), without mentioning the given method.The maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1) should be returned by the system.
