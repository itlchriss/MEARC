Preconditions:
The input parameter 'n' must be a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
The input parameter 'edges' must be a 2D array representing the edges between nodes in the graph.
The number of rows in the 'edges' array must be equal to the number of edges in the graph.
Each row in the 'edges' array must contain exactly two integers representing the nodes connected by the edge.
The nodes in the 'edges' array must be within the range of 0 to n-The graph represented by 'edges' must be connected, i.e., there must be a path between any two nodes in the graph.

Postconditions:
The method should return a list of integers representing the root labels of all Minimum Height Trees (MHTs) in the graph.
The list should contain the root labels in any order.
The number of elements in the list should be equal to the number of MHTs in the graph.
Each root label in the list should be within the range of 0 to n-The MHTs should have the minimum possible height in the graph.
The MHTs should be valid trees, i.e., they should not contain any cycles.
The MHTs should cover all nodes in the graph, i.e., there should be a path from each node to the root of an MHT.
