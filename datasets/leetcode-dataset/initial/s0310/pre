Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).
initial prepare.sh run.sh The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.
