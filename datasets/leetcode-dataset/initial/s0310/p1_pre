The input parameter 'n' must be a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
The input parameter 'edges' must be a 2D array representing the edges between nodes in the graph.
The number of rows in the 'edges' array must be equal to the number of edges in the graph.
Each row in the 'edges' array must contain exactly two integers representing the nodes connected by the edge.
The nodes in the 'edges' array must be within the range of 0 to n-The graph represented by 'edges' must be connected, i.e., there must be a path between any two nodes in the graph.
