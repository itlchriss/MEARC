The method should return a list of integers representing the root labels of all Minimum Height Trees (MHTs) in the graph.
The list should contain the root labels in any order.
The number of elements in the list should be equal to the number of MHTs in the graph.
Each root label in the list should be within the range of 0 to n-The MHTs should have the minimum possible height in the graph.
The MHTs should be valid trees, i.e., they should not contain any cycles.
The MHTs should cover all nodes in the graph, i.e., there should be a path from each node to the root of an MHT.
