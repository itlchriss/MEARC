The method should return a TreeNode object representing the merged tree.
The merged tree should contain all the nodes from both root1 and rootIf a node is present in both root1 and root2, the values of the nodes should be added together and assigned to the corresponding node in the merged tree.
If a node is present in only one of the trees (root1 or root2), it should be included as it is in the merged tree.
The structure of the merged tree should be such that the left subtree of any node in the merged tree represents the merged subtree of the corresponding nodes in root1 and root2, and the right subtree represents the merged subtree of the corresponding nodes in root1 and rootThe merged tree should be constructed in a way that preserves the original structure of both root1 and root2.
