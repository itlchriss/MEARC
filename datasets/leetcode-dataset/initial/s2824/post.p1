The length of the array `nums` should be equal to `n`, and the indices of the array `nums` should start from the length of the array `nums`.The presence of an integer `target` is required in the input.The count of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n` should be represented by the output. This count strictly adheres to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." The parameters `List<Integer> nums` and `int target` are explicitly related to the terms in the rephrased statement.For each pair of integers `(i, j)` in the parameter list `nums`, the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` must be less than the given `target` value.
