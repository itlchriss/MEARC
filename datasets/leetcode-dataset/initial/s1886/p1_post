The method should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to make `mat` equal to `target` by rotating `mat` in 90-degree increments.
If it is possible to make `mat` equal to `target`, the method should return `true`.
If it is not possible to make `mat` equal to `target`, the method should return `false`.
