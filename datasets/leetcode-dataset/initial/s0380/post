initial prepare.sh run.sh `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the **same probability** of being returned. randomizedSet.insert(2); // Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2]. randomizedSet.getRandom(); // getRandom() should return either 1 or 2 randomly. randomizedSet.remove(1); // Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2]. randomizedSet.insert(2); // 2 was already in the set, so return false. randomizedSet.getRandom(); // Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom() will always return 2.
initial prepare.sh run.sh `bool insert(int val)` Inserts an item `val` into the set if not present. Returns `true` if the item was not present, `false` otherwise. initial prepare.sh run.sh `bool remove(int val)` Removes an item `val` from the set if present. Returns `true` if the item was present, `false` otherwise. initial prepare.sh run.sh `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the **same probability** of being returned. randomizedSet.insert(1); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully. randomizedSet.remove(2); // Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
