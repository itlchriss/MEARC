The count of strings should be able to be stored by the data structure.The method `getMaxKey()` should be present in the data structure and it should return one of the keys with the maximum count.If the data structure does not contain any element, the method `getMaxKey()` should return an empty string `str_`.The method `getMinKey()` should be present in the data structure and it should return one of the keys with the minimum count.If the data structure does not contain any element, the method `getMinKey()` should return an empty string `str_`.The method `getMaxKey()` should return the key with the maximum count in the data structure, which should have a method `allOne . getMaxKey()`.The method `getMinKey()` should be present in the data structure and it should return the key with the minimum count.The initial invocation of `getMaxKey()` should yield the string "str_hello" in accordance with the syntax of the provided examples.The expected outcome is that the initial call to `getMinKey()` will return the string "str_hello" when using the public methods `Bucket(int cnt)`, `AllOne()`, `inc(String key)`, `dec(String key)`, `getMaxKey()`, and `getMinKey()`.The expected outcome is that the second invocation of the `getMaxKey()` method will return the string "str_hello".The expected outcome is for the second invocation of the `getMinKey()` method to return the string "str_leet".
