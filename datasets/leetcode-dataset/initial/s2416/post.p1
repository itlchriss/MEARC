The array of size n, determined by the value of n, should be returned by the system.The sum of scores for every non-empty prefix of words[i] must be represented by every element in the array.The name of the array that should be used to store the calculated sums of scores is str_answer.The determination of the size of the array should be solely based on the value of n.For every non-empty prefix of the input array words[i], encompassing all possible prefixes, the sum of scores should be calculated.When calculating the sum of scores, all non-empty prefixes of each word in the array of parameters should be considered.The sum of scores for each non-empty prefix of words[i] should be stored in the corresponding index of the answer array, i.e., answer[i].The condition should be met by the system in cases where the element at index i in the array words is empty.The condition of the system should be such that it can handle situations where the length of the array is zero or negative as well.
