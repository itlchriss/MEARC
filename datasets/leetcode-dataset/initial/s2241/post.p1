The `prepare . sh` script should be present in the system.The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. 
The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is a positive integer.The `run . sh` script should be present in the system.The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. 
The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is a positive integer.The function `withdraw(int amount)` should be present in the system, where the parameter `amount` represents the amount to be withdrawn.The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is sorted in ascending order."The length of the array returned by the `withdraw` function should be (It)."The `withdraw` function should return an array that contains the count of banknotes in the order of $20, $50, $100, $200, and $(It), which will be handed to the user.The number of banknotes in the ATM should be updated by the `withdraw` function after withdrawing.The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. 
The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is a positive integer.If the `withdraw` function is unable to withdraw any banknotes, the function should return [-1].The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. 
The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is a positive integer.The method `withdraw(int amount)` should be present in the system, where the parameter `amount` represents the amount to be withdrawn.The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. 
The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is a positive integer.The array of length (It) should be returned by the `atm . withdraw` method.The number of banknotes that will be handed to the user in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $(It) should be contained in the array returned by the `atm.withdraw` method.The number of banknotes in the ATM should be updated after withdrawing, when using the `withdraw` method with the parameter `amount`.The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is sorted in ascending order.If the banknotes cannot be withdrawn, the method `withdraw` should return [-1].The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. 
The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is a positive integer.When an amount of (It) is passed as a parameter, the `atm . withdraw` method should return [0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1].When the `withdraw` method is called with an amount of 600 and the machine attempts to use a $500 banknote, the expected return value should be [-1].The deposit method ensures that the banknotesCount parameter is not null. The withdraw method guarantees that the amount parameter is sorted in ascending order.When an amount of (It) is called, the return of [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] should be expected.
