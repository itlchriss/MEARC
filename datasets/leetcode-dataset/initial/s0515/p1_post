The method returns a list of integers.
The list contains the largest value in each row of the binary tree.
The list is in the same order as the rows of the binary tree.
The list is 0-indexed, meaning the first element corresponds to the largest value in the first row, the second element corresponds to the largest value in the second row, and so on.
If a row in the binary tree is empty, the corresponding element in the list will be null or a special value to indicate the absence of a largest value.
