Preconditions:
The method compareTo(Triplet obj) should only be called on objects of type Triplet.
The Triplet object passed as a parameter to the compareTo(Triplet obj) method should not be null.
The Triplet object passed as a parameter to the compareTo(Triplet obj) method should have valid values for its three attributes.

Postconditions:
The compareTo(Triplet obj) method should return a negative integer if the current Triplet object is smaller than the Triplet object passed as a parameter.
The compareTo(Triplet obj) method should return zero if the current Triplet object is equal to the Triplet object passed as a parameter.
The compareTo(Triplet obj) method should return a positive integer if the current Triplet object is larger than the Triplet object passed as a parameter.
The smallestRange(List<List<Integer>> nums) method should return an array of two integers representing the smallest range.
The smallest range should include at least one number from each of the k lists.
The smallest range should be the range with the smallest difference between the maximum and minimum numbers.
The smallest range should be calculated based on the numbers in the given list of lists (nums).
The smallest range should be calculated considering all possible combinations of numbers from the k lists.
