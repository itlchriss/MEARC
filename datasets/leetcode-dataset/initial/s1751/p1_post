The method should return an integer value representing the maximum sum of values that can be received by attending events.
The returned value should be greater than or equal to zero.
The returned value should be the sum of the maximum values from each row of the events array, considering the constraint of attending at most k events.
If k is greater than the number of events in any row, the method should consider attending all events in that row.
If k is less than or equal to zero, the method should return zero as the maximum sum of values.
