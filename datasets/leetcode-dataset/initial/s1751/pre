The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> event starts at <code>startDay<sub>i</sub></code> and ends at <code>endDay<sub>i</sub></code>, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of <code>value<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.
