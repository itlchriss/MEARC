Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` must have a length of `n`.
- The value of `n` must be greater than - The value of `p` must be within the range of `[0, n - 1]`.
- The input array `banned` must have a length of `k`.
- The value of `k` must be greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- The method should return an array `ans` of length `n`.
- For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, the value of `ans[i]` should be the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the `1` to position `i` in `arr`.
- If it is impossible to bring the `1` to position `i` in `arr`, the value of `ans[i]` should be `-1`.
