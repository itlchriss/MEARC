The method should return an array `ans` of length `n`.
For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, the value of `ans[i]` should be the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the `1` to position `i` in `arr`.
If it is impossible to bring the `1` to position `i` in `arr`, the value of `ans[i]` should be `-1`.
