Preconditions:
- The method takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `n` as input.
- The value of `a` is greater than or equal to - The value of `b` is greater than or equal to - The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned value is the maximum value of `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` where `0 <= x < 2^n`.
- The returned value is modulo `10^9 + 7`.
