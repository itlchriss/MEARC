To find the maximum value of `(a XOR x) ⊕ (b XOR x)` where `0 <= x < 2^n`, we can use the Java method `maximumXorProduct` which takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `n` as parameters. The method returns an integer value, which should be computed modulo `10^9 + 7` to avoid exceeding the maximum value.

In this algorithm, we iterate through all possible values of `x` from 0 to `2^n 1`. For each `x`, we calculate `(a XOR x) ⊕ (b XOR x)` and keep track of the maximum value encountered so far. Finally, we return the maximum value modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Note that the answer may be too large, hence the modulo operation is necessary to ensure the result fits within the integer data type.
