Preconditions:
The method should take two parameters: an integer n representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a 2D integer array edges representing the edges between nodes.
The value of n should be greater than or equal to The length of the edges array should be equal to n-Each element in the edges array should be a 2-element array representing an edge between two nodes.
The nodes in the edges array should be represented by integers from 1 to n.
The tree represented by the edges array should be a valid tree, i.e., it should not contain any cycles.

Postconditions:
The method should return a long value representing the number of valid paths in the tree.
The returned value should be greater than or equal to 0.
