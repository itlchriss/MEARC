- The length of `cars` is greater than or equal to - Each element in `cars` is an array of length 2, representing the position and speed of a car.
- The position of each car is a non-negative integer.
- The speed of each car is a positive integer.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an array of doubles.
- The length of the returned array is equal to the length of `cars`.
- Each element in the returned array is a double representing the time at which the corresponding car collides with the next car.
