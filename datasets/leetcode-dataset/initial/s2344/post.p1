Preconditions:
- The method takes in two arrays, `nums` and `numsDivide`, as parameters.
- Both `nums` and `numsDivide` are non-null arrays.
- Both `nums` and `numsDivide` are non-empty arrays.
- All elements in `nums` and `numsDivide` are integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- If the smallest element in `nums` divides all the elements in `numsDivide`, the method returns the minimum number of deletions required to achieve this.
- If it is not possible for the smallest element in `nums` to divide all the elements in `numsDivide`, the method returns -1.
