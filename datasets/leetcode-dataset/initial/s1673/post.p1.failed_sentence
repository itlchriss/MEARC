The input for the algorithm consists of an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.The subsequence of `nums` with a size of `k` should be returned by the algorithm.The subsequence that should be returned by the method is the most competitive subsequence, where the method takes in an array of integers called "nums" and an integer called "k" representing the length of the subsequence.Based on the order of elements in the `nums` array, the determination of the subsequence should be made.The selection of the smallest possible elements from the `nums` array should determine the subsequence.If there exist multiple subsequences with the same competitiveness, the algorithm should return the subsequence that has the smallest possible elements, given that the method takes in an array of integers called "nums" and an integer called "k" as parameters.The condition where the length of the `nums` array is less than `k` should be handled by the algorithm.The length of `nums` should be handled by the algorithm in cases where `k` is equal to it.The condition where `k` is less than the length of `nums` should be handled by the algorithm.The condition of the algorithm should account for situations in which the parameter array, `nums`, includes negative integers.The situation should be handled by the algorithm in cases where the array `nums` contains duplicate integers.The condition of an empty array should be handled by the algorithm when the parameter array, `nums`, is empty.The condition should be met when the value of `k` is equal to the length of the `nums` array minus 1.
