The 2D integer array `nums` is the input, where each element `nums[i]` in `nums` is a non-empty array of distinct positive integers.The integers that are found in every array of `nums` and are sorted in ascending order make up the output.The list of output integers will be empty only if there are no integers present in each array of `nums`.
