Given a 2D integer array `nums`, where each `nums[i]` is a non-empty array of distinct positive integers, the algorithm should return a list of integers in ascending order that are present in each array of `nums`. For example, if `nums[0] = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, `nums[1] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, and `nums[2] = [3, 4, 5, 6]`, the only integers present in all three arrays are 3 and 4. Therefore, the algorithm should yield [3, 4]. If there is no integer present in both `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`, the algorithm should return an empty list.
