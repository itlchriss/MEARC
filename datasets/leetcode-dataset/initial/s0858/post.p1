Preconditions:
The method should take two integer parameters `p` and `q`.
The values of `p` and `q` should be positive integers.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.
The returned value should be one of the following: 0, 1, or The returned value should be based on the direction of the ray and the position of the receptors.
If the ray hits the receptor at position 0, the method should return If the ray hits the receptor at position `p`, the method should return If the ray hits the receptor at position `q`, the method should return The method should handle cases where the ray hits multiple receptors simultaneously and return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.
