The returned array is not null.
The length of the returned array is equal to `n`.
The sum of the elements in the returned array, when added to the elements in the input array `rolls`, results in a new array with a length of `n + m`, where `m` is the length of the input array `rolls`.
The average value of the elements in the new array is exactly equal to the input integer `mean`.
If there are multiple valid answers, any of them can be returned.
If no such array exists, an empty array is returned.
