You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes of a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (DAG). The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there is a **unidirectional** edge from <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> in the graph.
