The input parameter `n` must be a positive integer representing the number of nodes.
The input parameter `edges` must be a 2D array representing the edges between nodes.
The number of rows in `edges` must be equal to the number of nodes `n`.
The number of columns in `edges` must be 2, representing the source and destination nodes of each edge.
The values in `edges` must be valid node indices, ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
The edges must form a valid directed acyclic graph (DAG) without any cycles.
