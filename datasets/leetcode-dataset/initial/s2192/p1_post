The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents the ancestors of a node.
The size of the returned list should be equal to the number of nodes `n`.
Each inner list should be sorted in ascending order.
The ancestors of a node `i` should not include the node itself.
The ancestors of a node `i` should only include nodes that have a directed path to `i` in the given graph.
