The Java method `longestPrefix` takes a string `s` as input and returns the longest happy prefix of `s`. If no such prefix exists, the method returns an empty string `str_`. The algorithm used in this method ensures that the returned prefix is the longest possible and satisfies the condition of being a happy prefix.
