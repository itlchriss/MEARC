The method should return an integer value which is the sum of `a` and `b`.
The returned sum should be calculated without using the `+` and `-` operators.
The returned sum should be the correct sum of `a` and `b` regardless of their values.
The method should handle both positive and negative values of `a` and `b`.
The method should handle cases where the sum of `a` and `b` exceeds the maximum value of an integer.
The method should handle cases where the sum of `a` and `b` is less than the minimum value of an integer.
