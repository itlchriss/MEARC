The method `getCommon` takes two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` as parameters, which are sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns the minimum common integer between the two arrays. If there is no common integer, the method returns -1. In the context of this method, the smallest common element between `nums1` and `nums2` is 2, so the method returns 2. Among the common elements 2 and 3, the smallest element is 2, which is then returned by the method.
