The arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are included in the input, both of which are sorted in non-decreasing order.The minimum integer that is common to both arrays is represented by the output, and it is an integer.In the case where there is no shared integer between the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, the output will be -The smallest common element is returned if there are multiple common elements, and these common elements are integers.The elements that are common to both `nums1` and `nums2` are present, and they are arranged in non-decreasing order.The minimum integers in both arrays, which are the common elements, are also present.
