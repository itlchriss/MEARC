The method `minTimeToVisitAllPoints` takes a 2D array `points` as input, where each element `points[i]` represents a point with integer coordinates `[x_i, y_i]` on a 2D plane. The method calculates the minimum time in seconds required to visit all the points in the order specified by the `points` array. The result of the method is an integer representing the minimum time.
