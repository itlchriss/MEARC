The minimum time required to visit all the points should be able to be calculated by the system.The order of the points given in the input should be considered by the system.The 2D plane with 'n' points should be handled by the system.The condition for the system is that points with integer coordinates should be handled.The distance between two points on the 2D plane can be calculated by the system.The time required to travel from one point to another based on the distance can be calculated by the system, ensuring that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The time required to travel between all the points in the given order should be summed up by the system.The minimum time in seconds to visit all the points should be returned by the system.
