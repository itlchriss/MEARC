To find the center of a star graph in a Java method with the signature `public int findCenter(int[][] edges)`, the user is provided with a 2D integer array `edges` that represents the edges between nodes. Each element `edges[i]` is an array `[u_i, v_i]` which indicates an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`. The algorithm returns the center of the given star graph.
