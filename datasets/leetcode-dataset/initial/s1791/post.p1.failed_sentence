The input for the method should be an integer array `edges` that is in the form of a 2D array.Each array in the `edges` parameter should consist of two integers, representing a connection between two nodes.The center of the star graph is expected to be returned by the function, with the given array of edges as the parameter.The node that is connected to all other nodes in the graph is the center of the star graph.The integer representing the center node should be returned.
