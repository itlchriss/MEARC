The freshness of each orange in the cells should be considered in order for the system to accurately calculate the minimum number of minutes required for all cells to lack fresh oranges.The condition where fresh oranges cannot be absent in every cell necessitates the system to monitor the elapsed time in minutes and refresh the freshness of the oranges in each cell after every minute.After each minute, the presence of any fresh orange in each cell should be checked.If the grid parameter does not contain any fresh oranges in all of its cells, the calculation should be stopped and the elapsed time should be returned.The scenario in which every cell is unable to contain any fresh orange should be addressed.The scenario should be considered when there are no fresh oranges initially in any cell.The scenario of having no cells should be handled by the method, ensuring that the parameter array does not contain any elements.The scenario of having only one cell with a fresh orange initially should be accounted for.Considering the different freshness levels, the case where there are multiple cells with fresh oranges initially should be handled.The case where there are multiple cells with the same freshness level of oranges initially should be handled.The scenario of having multiple cells with no fresh oranges initially should be handled by the method in a way that strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples and uses no pronouns.
