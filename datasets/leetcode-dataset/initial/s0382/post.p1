The system should contain a ListNode parameter named "head" that represents a singly linked list. Additionally, the system should contain an int parameter named "getRandom" that returns the value of a random node from the linked list.The probability of choosing each node in the linked list should be equal, so the getRandom() method should randomly select a node from the list.Furthermore, the value of the selected node should be returned by the getRandom() method, and all the nodes in the list should have an equal likelihood of being chosen.The existence of a method named "solution.getRandom()" is required for the system. This method should return the value of a random node from the linked list. Additionally, this method should be present in a class that has a public constructor with a parameter of type "ListNode" named "head".The outcome of the getRandom() method should not be null. Furthermore, the array of parameters should be arranged in ascending order. The expected behavior of the method is that it returns the number 1 initially. Additionally, it should return the number 2 twice consecutively.The outcome of the method should not be null. The array of parameters should be arranged in ascending order.The probability of each element in the linked list being returned by the getRandom() method should be equal, given that the method public Solution(ListNode head) is used.
