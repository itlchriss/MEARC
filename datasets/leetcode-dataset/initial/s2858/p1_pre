The input parameter `n` should be a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
The input parameter `edges` should be a 2D array representing the directed edges between nodes in the graph.
The number of rows in the `edges` array should be equal to the number of nodes `n`.
The number of columns in each row of the `edges` array should be equal to the number of nodes `n`.
The values in the `edges` array should be either 0 or 1, representing the presence or absence of a directed edge between two nodes.
The graph represented by the `edges` array should be a connected graph, i.e., there should be a path between any two nodes in the graph.
