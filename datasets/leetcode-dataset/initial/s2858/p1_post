The method should return an integer array `answer` of size `n`.
Each element `answer[i]` in the `answer` array should represent the minimum number of edge reversals required to reach any other node starting from node `i`.
The values in the `answer` array should be non-negative integers.
The values in the `answer` array should be calculated based on the given sequence of directed edges in the graph.
If it is not possible to reach any other node starting from node `i` through a sequence of directed edges, the value of `answer[i]` should be -1.
