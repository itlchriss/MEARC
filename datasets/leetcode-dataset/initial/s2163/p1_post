The method should return a long value representing the minimum difference between the sums of the two parts after the removal of `n` elements.
The method should not modify the input array `nums`.
The method should handle the case when `n` is 0 and return the absolute difference between the sums of the two parts.
The method should handle the case when `n` is equal to the length of the input array `nums` and return 0, as all elements are removed.
The method should handle the case when `n` is less than the length of the input array `nums` and return the minimum difference between the sums of the two parts after removing `n` elements.
The method should handle the case when there are multiple valid solutions and return any one of them.
