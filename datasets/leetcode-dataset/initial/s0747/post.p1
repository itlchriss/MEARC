The Java method "dominantIndex" takes an array of integers as input and determines if the largest element in the array is at least twice the size of every other number. If it is, the method returns the index of the largest element. Otherwise, it returns -1. 

For example, if the largest integer in the array is 6 and it is at least twice as big as every other number, the method will return the index of the value 6, which is 1. 

On the other hand, if the largest integer is not at least twice the size of every other number, such as when 4 is less than twice the value of 3, the method will return -1. 

To implement this algorithm, the method "dominantIndex" can be used in conjunction with the method "findNum" which takes a target value and an array as input and returns the index of the target value in the array.
