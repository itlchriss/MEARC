The number of ways for the pointer to remain at index 0 precisely after `steps` steps should be calculated by the function with two integer inputs: `steps` and `arrLen`.The expected outcome is an integer value, and the function should handle cases where the result may be too large by returning the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
