The method should return a List object containing List objects of Integers, representing the closest nodes to each query.
The size of the returned List object should be equal to the number of queries.
Each List object within the returned List should contain the closest nodes to the corresponding query.
The order of the closest nodes within each List object should be maintained.
If there are multiple nodes with the same closest distance to a query, they should be included in the same List object in the order they appear in the tree.
