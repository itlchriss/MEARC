Preconditions:
The `root` of the binary tree is not null.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the sum of every tree node's tilt.
The tilt of a tree node is calculated as the absolute difference between the sum of left subtree node values and the sum of right subtree node values.
If a tree node has no left or right subtree, the sum of that subtree is considered to be The tilt of the root node is the sum of the tilts of all its child nodes.
The tilt of a leaf node is The method handles both positive and negative node values in the binary tree.
The method handles binary trees with varying numbers of nodes.
The method handles binary trees with varying structures (e.g., balanced, unbalanced, skewed).
The method handles binary trees with duplicate node values.
The method handles binary trees with null nodes.
The method handles binary trees with negative node values.
The method handles binary trees with large node values that may exceed the range of integer data type.
The method returns 0 if the binary tree is empty (i.e., root is null).
