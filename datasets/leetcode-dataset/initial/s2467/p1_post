The method returns an integer representing the maximum net income Alice can have.
Alice's net income is calculated by subtracting the amount of money she spends at each node from the amount of money she has at that node.
Alice can only travel towards leaf nodes, which are nodes that do not have any children.
Alice can only travel along the edges of the tree.
Alice can only travel in one direction, towards the leaf nodes.
Alice can choose any path that leads to a leaf node.
The maximum net income is calculated by finding the path that results in the highest net income for Alice.
If there are multiple paths that result in the same maximum net income, the method can return any one of those paths.
