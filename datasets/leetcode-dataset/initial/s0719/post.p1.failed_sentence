The input for the function consists of an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, where `nums` represents the array of integers and `k` represents the desired position.The kth smallest distance among all the pairs of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` should be returned by the function.The array `nums` should strictly consist of integers.The array `nums` must not be empty for the method to work correctly.The integer `k` must be a positive integer for the method to work correctly.The function should take into account every combination of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`, in order to strictly adhere to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order.".The calculation of the distance between each pair of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` should be performed by the function.The kth smallest distance among all the calculated distances should be found by the function, given that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The output should be the kth smallest distance, where the parameter array is the input and the function returns the result.
