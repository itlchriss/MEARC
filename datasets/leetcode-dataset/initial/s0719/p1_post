The method should return an integer value representing the kth smallest distance among all the pairs in the array `nums`.
The returned distance should be the distance between the elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.
The returned distance should be the kth smallest distance among all the pairs in the array `nums`.
