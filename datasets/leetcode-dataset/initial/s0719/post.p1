Preconditions:
The input array `nums` must not be null.
The input array `nums` must have at least two elements.
The input integer `k` must be greater than or equal to The input integer `k` must be less than or equal to the total number of possible pairs in the array `nums`.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the kth smallest distance among all the pairs in the array `nums`.
The returned distance should be calculated based on the absolute difference between the elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.
The returned distance should be the smallest among all the possible distances between pairs in the array `nums`.
The method should not modify the input array `nums` or its elements.
The method should not modify the input integer `k`.
