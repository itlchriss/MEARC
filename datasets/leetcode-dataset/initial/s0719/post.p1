The input array `nums` must have at least two elements.
The input integer `k` must be greater than or equal to The input integer `k` must be less than or equal to the total number of possible pairs in the array `nums`.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the kth smallest distance among all the pairs in the array `nums`.
The returned distance should be the distance between the elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.
The returned distance should be the kth smallest distance among all the pairs in the array `nums`.
