To find the minimum absolute sum difference, you need to replace at most one element in the array `nums1`. This can be achieved by comparing each element of `nums1` with the corresponding element in `nums2`. The absolute difference between these elements should be calculated and the minimum value should be tracked. Finally, return this minimum absolute sum difference modulo 10^9 + 7.
