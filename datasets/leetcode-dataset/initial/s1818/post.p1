The function should return the calculated minimum absolute sum difference.The calculation of the minimum absolute sum difference should occur after replacing at most one element in the array `nums1`, and the calculation must be performed.The returned value, which should be the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`, should be returned.The array nums1 contains sorted elements in ascending order.The minimum absolute sum difference in all three sentences is referred to by the term "str_it", which strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." The term "str_it" clearly applies to the parameters "nums1" and "nums2" in the method public int minAbsoluteSumDiff.
