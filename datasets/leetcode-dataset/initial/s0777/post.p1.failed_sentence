The characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'X'` strictly compose the string, adhering to the syntax of the parameters `start` and `end` in the method `public boolean canTransform(String start, String end)`, where the parameter `start` represents the initial string and the parameter `end` represents the final string.A transformation in the method `canTransform(String start, String end)` involves the replacement of either one occurrence of `str_XL` with `"LX"` or one occurrence of `"RX"` with `"XR"`.The string that marks the beginning is provided as `start`, and the string that marks the conclusion is provided as `end`.If a sequence of moves exists that can transform the string `start` to the string `end`, the expected outcome should be `True`.In the event that there is no sequence of moves capable of transforming the string `start` to the string `end`, the expected outcome should be `False`.
