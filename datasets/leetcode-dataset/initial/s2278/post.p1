The method `percentageLetter` takes a string `s` and a character `letter` as input. It calculates the percentage of characters in the string `s` that are equal to the character `letter`. This percentage is then rounded down to the nearest whole percent. 

For example, if the string `s` has 6 characters and 2 of them are equal to the letter 'o', the percentage would be calculated as 2 divided by 6, multiplied by 100%. The result, 33%, is then rounded down to 33. Similarly, if there are no characters in `s` that equal the letter 'k', the percentage would be 0% and the method would return 0.
