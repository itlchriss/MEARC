Given a string `s` and a character `letter`, return _the **percentage** of characters in_ `s` _that equal_ `letter` _**rounded down** to the nearest whole percent._ The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'o' is 2 / 6 \* 100% = 33% when rounded down, so we return 33. The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'k' is 0%, so we return 0.
