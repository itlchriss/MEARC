Preconditions:
The expression parameter must not be null.
The evalvars parameter must not be null.
The evalints parameter must not be null.
The length of evalvars array must be equal to the length of evalints array.

Postconditions:
The method should return a List<String> object.
The returned list should contain tokens representing the simplified expression.
The tokens should be in the correct order as per the expression.
The tokens should be simplified based on the evaluation map provided.
If a variable in the expression is present in the evalvars array, it should be replaced with the corresponding value from evalints array.
If a variable in the expression is not present in the evalvars array, it should remain unchanged in the token.
The tokens should be in the form of "coefficient*variable" if the coefficient is not The tokens should be in the form of "variable" if the coefficient is The tokens should be in the form of "-variable" if the coefficient is -The tokens should be in the form of "constant" if the token represents a constant value.
