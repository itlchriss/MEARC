The function `basicCalculatorIV` takes in an expression, represented by the string `expression`, and an evaluation map, represented by the arrays `evalvars` and `evalints`. The expression is in the form of a mathematical equation, with variables and arithmetic operations. The evaluation map provides the values for some of the variables in the expression.

To simplify the expression, the function evaluates the variables in the expression using the evaluation map. It replaces the variables with their corresponding values in the expression. The result is a simplified expression with only constants and arithmetic operations.

The function then converts the simplified expression into a list of tokens. Each token represents a part of the expression, such as a constant or an arithmetic operation. The tokens are stored in a list, which is the result of the function.

For example, given the expression `expression = "e + 8 a + 5"` and the evaluation map `evalvars = ["e"]` and `evalints = [1]`, the function would return a list of tokens `["-1*a" , "14"]`. This means that the simplified expression is `-1*a + 14`, where `a` is replaced with its evaluated value of `-1` and `e` is replaced with its evaluated value of `1`.
