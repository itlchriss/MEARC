The method should return a List<Integer> containing two elements: `total_jumbo` and `total_small`.
The sum of `total_jumbo` and `total_small` should be equal to the number of remaining `tomatoSlices`.
The sum of `total_jumbo` and `total_small` should be equal to the number of remaining `cheeseSlices`.
If it is not possible to make the remaining `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` equal to `0`, the method should return an empty List<Integer>.
