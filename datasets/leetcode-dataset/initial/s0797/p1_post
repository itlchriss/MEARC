The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a path from node `0` to node `n - 1`.
The order of the paths in the returned list can be arbitrary.
Each path in the returned list should be represented as a list of integers, where each integer represents a node in the path.
The returned list should contain all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`.
