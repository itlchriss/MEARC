The method should take three parameters: an integer m, an integer n, and a 2D integer array ops.
The integer m represents the number of rows in the matrix.
The integer n represents the number of columns in the matrix.
The 2D integer array ops represents a series of operations to be performed on the matrix.
The matrix should be non-empty.
