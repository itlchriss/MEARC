The health of the robots that survive the collisions shall be determined by someone.The order in which the robots were given should be used to determine their health.If there are no survivors, the method shall return an empty array.When collisions occur, the robots that have the same health will be removed.In the case of collisions, the robot with a smaller health will be eliminated.After the collision occurs, the health of the remaining robot(s) shall be updated in the case of collisions.An array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input) shall be returned by someone once no further collisions can occur.
