Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The input array `nums` contains at least two elements.
- The input array `nums` only contains integers.
- The input integer `k` is not null.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long value representing the number of distinct excellent pairs.
- An excellent pair is defined as a pair of integers `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are elements of the input array `nums` and `a + b = k`.
- The method counts distinct excellent pairs, meaning that if there are multiple pairs with the same values `(a, b)`, they are only counted once.
- The method does not modify the input array `nums` or the input integer `k`.
