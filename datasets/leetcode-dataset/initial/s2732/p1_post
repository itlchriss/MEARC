The method should return a List<Integer> object.
The List<Integer> object should contain the row indices of a good subset.
The row indices in the List<Integer> object should be sorted in ascending order.
If there are multiple good subsets, the method can return any of them.
If there are no good subsets, the method should return an empty array.
