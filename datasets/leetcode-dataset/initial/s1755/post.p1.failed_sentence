The absolute difference between the sum and the goal value should be calculated by the system, regardless of whether it is positive or negative.The minimum possible value of the absolute difference should be returned by the system, taking into account both positive and negative values of the parameter array and the goal parameter.The sum of a set of values, regardless of their decimal or large nature, should be considered by the system.The desired target value, regardless of whether it is positive or negative, should be considered by the system as the goal.The sum and the goal, both positive and negative values, should be handled by the system, ensuring accurate calculations.The sum and the goal should be able to handle decimal values, allowing for precise calculations.The sum and the goal parameters in the method should be able to handle large values, ensuring accurate results.The method should handle scenarios in which the sum of the nums array is equal to the goal, resulting in a minimum value. The method should also handle scenarios in which the sum of the nums array is greater than the goal, resulting in a positive minimum value.The sum of the elements in the parameter array should be less than the goal in order for the system to return a positive minimum value.In the case where both the sum and the goal are negative, the system should return a positive minimum value, handling it appropriately.The case where both the sum and the goal are positive should be handled by the system, resulting in a minimum value that is positive.The sum and the goal having different signs, a positive minimum value should be returned by the system when handling cases where the sum and the goal have different signs.The sum and the goal having the same sign, a positive minimum value should be returned by the system when handling cases where the sum and the goal have the same sign.The scenario of both the sum and the goal being zero should be handled by the system, which should return a minimum value of 0.
