To find the highest overall score among all possible basketball teams, we can use the Java method `bestTeamScore(int[] scores, int[] ages)`. This method takes two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each element at index `i` represents the score and age of the `i`th player, respectively. By implementing an algorithm, we can determine the team with the highest overall score by considering the scores and ages of each player in the lists.
