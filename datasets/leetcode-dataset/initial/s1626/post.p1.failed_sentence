The input for the system should consist of two lists, `scores` and `ages`, which the system should be able to receive.The length of both the scores array and the ages array should be the same, as ensured by the system.Each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` should be considered by the system as the score and age of the `i-th` player, respectively.The scores array should contain the scores of each basketball team, and the ages array should contain the ages of the players. The overall score of each possible basketball team should be calculated by the system.The highest overall score among all possible basketball teams should be determined by the system, given the parameter array of scores and the parameter array of ages, where the scores array represents the scores of the basketball teams and the ages array represents the ages of the players in the teams, and both arrays are sorted in ascending order.The output should be the highest overall score returned by the system when the scores array and ages array are provided as parameters.
