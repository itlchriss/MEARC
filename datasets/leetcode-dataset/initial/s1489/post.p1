Preconditions:
The input parameter 'n' must be a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
The input parameter 'edges' must be a 2D array of integers representing the edges of the graph.
The number of rows in the 'edges' array must be equal to the number of edges in the graph.
Each row in the 'edges' array must contain exactly 3 integers: the source vertex, the destination vertex, and the weight of the edge.
The source and destination vertices in each edge must be valid vertex indices within the range [0, n-1].
The weight of each edge must be a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
The method should return a list of lists, where each inner list represents a set of critical or pseudo-critical edges.
The first inner list in the output should contain the indices of the critical edges, i.e., the edges that appear in all minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of the graph.
The second inner list in the output should contain the indices of the pseudo-critical edges, i.e., the edges that appear in some but not all MSTs of the graph.
The order of the edges in each inner list does not matter.
The indices of the edges in the output should be within the range [0, number of edges - 1].
The output lists should not contain any duplicate edge indices.
The output lists should be sorted in ascending order of the edge indices.
