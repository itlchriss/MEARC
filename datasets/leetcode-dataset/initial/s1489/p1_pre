The input parameter 'n' must be a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
The input parameter 'edges' must be a 2D array of integers representing the edges of the graph.
The number of rows in the 'edges' array must be equal to the number of edges in the graph.
Each row in the 'edges' array must contain exactly 3 integers: the source vertex, the destination vertex, and the weight of the edge.
The source and destination vertices in each edge must be valid vertex indices within the range [0, n-1].
The weight of each edge must be a non-negative integer.
