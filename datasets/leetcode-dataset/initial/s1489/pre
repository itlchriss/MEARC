Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find _all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST)_. An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a _critical edge_. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all. **Explanation:** We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.
