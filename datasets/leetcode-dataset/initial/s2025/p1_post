The method returns an integer value representing the maximum possible number of ways to partition the array `nums` after changing at most one element.
The original array `nums` remains unchanged after the method execution.
The partitioning of the array `nums` satisfies both conditions:
 a. The sum of the elements in each partition is equal to `k`.
 b. The number of partitions is maximized.
