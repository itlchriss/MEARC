The maximum possible achievable number should be calculated and returned by the system, strictly adhering to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order.", without using any pronouns. This should be done by explicitly relating the parameters "num" and "t" to the terms in the statement.The existence of at least one achievable number should be proven by the system, strictly adhering to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." This proof should be provided in relation to the parameters "num" and "t" in the method public int theMaximumAchievableX(int num, int t).In order to determine the maximum achievable number, the system should consider all possible numbers, with the parameter "num" being the number to be considered and the parameter "t" representing the criteria for achieving the maximum.The method public int theMaximumAchievableX(int num, int t) should handle different types of numbers (e.g., integers, decimals) in order to achieve the maximum value for X.In order to calculate the maximum achievable number, the integers and decimals must be sorted in ascending order.In order to calculate the maximum achievable number, the handling of different ranges of numbers should be done by the system.The explanation of how the maximum achievable number is determined should be provided clearly and understandably by the system.In order to calculate the maximum achievable number, the ability to handle large numbers should be present in the system.The maximum achievable number should be efficiently calculated by the system.
