Given the string `s`, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. That is, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' must appear an even number of times.
**Explanation:** In this case, the given string "bcbcbc" is the longest because all vowels: **a**, **e**, **i**, **o** and run.sh appear zero times.
