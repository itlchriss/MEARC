The minimum score of the list of numbers should be calculable by the system, with the given list of numbers being the parameter and the minimum score being the result. The parameter list of numbers should have a difference of at least k between each element.The operation should be applied to each index in the list, ensuring it is done only once, with the capability of the system, given that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order and the result is not null.The operation should be applied to each index, considering all possible combinations, in order to calculate the minimum score.The minimum score should be returned by the system after applying the operation to the parameter array with a difference of at most k.The input array should be capable of accommodating lists of any size.The list of numbers in the parameter array should include both positive and negative numbers, and the system should be capable of handling them.The list of decimal numbers in the parameter array should be able to be handled by the system.The list of numbers in the parameter array should be able to contain duplicate numbers, and the system should be capable of handling them.The input list, represented by the parameter array, may be empty, and the system should be capable of handling this scenario.The input list should consist of only one number, and the system should be capable of handling it.The list, where all numbers are the same, should be able to be handled by the system.The list, where all numbers are negative, should be able to be handled by the system.The list, where all numbers are positive, should be able to be handled by the system.The list with alternating positive and negative numbers should be able to be handled by the system.The list with alternating negative and positive numbers should be able to be handled by the system.The list containing both positive and negative numbers should be handled by the system.The list containing positive, negative, and zero numbers should be handled by the system.The list containing a combination of integer and decimal numbers should be handled by the system.The array of elements in the parameter should be capable of accommodating a significant number of elements.The array of integers, nums, should be sorted in ascending order in order for the system to be able to handle a list with a small number of elements.
