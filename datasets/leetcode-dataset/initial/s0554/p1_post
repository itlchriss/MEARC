The method returns an integer representing the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing a vertical line.
The vertical line is drawn such that it passes through the wall, crossing the fewest number of bricks.
The vertical line can be drawn at any position within the width of the wall.
The vertical line does not cross any bricks at the edges of the wall.
If there are multiple positions where the vertical line can be drawn to cross the same minimum number of bricks, the method returns the position that appears first in the input `wall`.
