Return _a list of **all** days **(0-indexed)** that are good days to rob the bank_. _The order that the days are returned in does **not** matter._ **Explanation:** Since time equals 0, every day is a good day to rob the bank, so return every day. Thus, no day is a good day to rob the bank, so return an empty list.
