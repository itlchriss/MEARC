Preconditions:
- The security array must not be null.
- The time value must be a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
- The method should return a List<Integer> object.
- The returned list should contain all the days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank.
- The order of the days in the returned list does not matter.
- If the time value is 0, every day is considered a good day to rob the bank, so the returned list should contain all the days.
- If the time value is greater than 0, no day is considered a good day to rob the bank, so the returned list should be empty.
