The list of all days suitable for robbing the bank should be returned by the system. The time should not be the same. The days should be returned in a 0-indexed format, with the first day indicated as index. The order of the days in the list is not important, as long as all the suitable days are included.If the time is 0, every day is considered a good day for robbing the bank, assuming the security array is sorted in ascending order.If there is no day that can be considered a good day to rob the bank, the system should return a list that is empty.
