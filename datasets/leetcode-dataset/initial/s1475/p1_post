The output array `finalPrices` is not null.
The length of the output array `finalPrices` is equal to the length of the input array `prices`.
For each element `finalPrices[i]` in the output array, it represents the final price to be paid for the `ith` item of the shop.
The final price `finalPrices[i]` is calculated by subtracting the special discount from the original price `prices[i]`.
If there is no special discount available for an item, the final price `finalPrices[i]` will be equal to the original price `prices[i]`.
