The method returns a List<Double> containing the average value of the nodes on each level of the binary tree.
The List<Double> has the same number of elements as the number of levels in the binary tree.
The average values in the List<Double> are calculated with a precision of 10^-- The order of the average values in the List<Double> corresponds to the level order traversal of the binary tree.
