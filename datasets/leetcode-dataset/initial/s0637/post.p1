The input for the algorithm, which is the root of a binary tree, serves as the starting point.The average value of the nodes on each level is contained in the output (an array), providing a summary of the tree's data.The precision of the average value, accurate to within 10^-5 of the actual answer, ensures a high level of accuracy for the average values calculated from the levels of the TreeNode root.The average value of nodes on level 0, which is the initial level of the tree, is included in the output array.Moreover, the resulting list contains the average values of the nodes on level 1, thus providing insights into the second level of the tree.The output array provides insights into the third level of the tree, including the average value of nodes on level 2.The average value of nodes on each subsequent level is encompassed by the output array, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the entire tree.The calculation of the average value is achieved by summing the values of all nodes on a level and dividing the resulting sum by the number of nodes on that level, guaranteeing a precise representation of the average.The levels of the binary tree can vary in number, providing flexibility in both its structure and complexity.The TreeNode root can have any number of nodes on each level, allowing for different sizes and densities of data to be accommodated in a similar manner.The nodes of the binary tree can have any values, allowing for a wide range of data types and values to be stored.The structure of the binary tree can vary, but it must follow the rules and requirements of a valid binary tree to ensure the applicability of the algorithm to different tree configurations.The hierarchical structure of the data is preserved by the output array, maintaining the same order as the levels of the binary tree.The average values as floating-point numbers are contained in the output array, allowing for precise representation of the average values.The array of output values, which contains the average values with a precision of 5 decimal places, ensures a consistent level of accuracy in the reported averages.
