The Java method `averageOfLevels(TreeNode root)` accepts the `root` of a binary tree as a parameter. It calculates the average value of the nodes on each level and returns the result as an array. The reader will consider answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer as acceptable. For example, if the average values of nodes on level 0, level 1, and level 2 are 3, 14.5, and 11 respectively, the reader will return [3, 14.5, 11]. This algorithm can be understood by stating that the average value of nodes on each level is calculated and stored in the resulting array.
