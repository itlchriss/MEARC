The input parameter `n` must be a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
The input parameter `edges` must be a 2D array representing the edges between nodes in the tree.
The number of rows in the `edges` array must be equal to `n-1`, as there can be at most `n-1` edges in a tree with `n` nodes.
