The integer value that the program should return is the missing integer in the sorted ascending order array of integers, nums.The smallest integer missing from the given list of numbers should be found by the program.The sum of the longest sequential prefix should be less than or equal to the missing integer.The sum of consecutive numbers from the beginning of the list should be considered as the longest sequential prefix by the program, given that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The list of numbers, which the parameter array represents, should include both positive and negative numbers, and the program should be able to handle them.The list of numbers, which is the parameter array, should be able to handle duplicate numbers, and the program should properly handle this situation.The array of integers, nums, should be handled by the program in such a way that if it is empty, an appropriate error message or value should be returned.The array of integers, named "nums", should be handled by the program. It is expected that the array contains only one number. In this case, the program should return an error message or value that is appropriate for the situation.The list of integers, represented by the parameter array, must exclusively contain negative numbers. In this case, the program should appropriately handle this scenario and either display an error message or return a suitable value.The list of positive numbers should be handled by the program, and an appropriate error message or value should be returned.The list with a mix of positive and negative numbers should be handled by the program, and an appropriate error message or value should be returned.The list of floating-point numbers should be handled by the program, and an appropriate error message or value should be returned.The array of integers, nums, should be handled by the program, even if it contains non-numeric values. In such cases, the program should return an error message or value that is appropriate.The method should efficiently handle an array with a large number of elements.The output of the program should be the missing integer, which is returned.
