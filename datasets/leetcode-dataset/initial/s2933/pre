You are given a 2D **0-indexed** array of strings, `access_times`, with size `n`. For each `i` where `0 <= i <= n - 1`, `access_times[i][0]` represents the name of an employee, and `access_times[i][1]` represents the access time of that employee. All entries in `access_times` are within the same day.
