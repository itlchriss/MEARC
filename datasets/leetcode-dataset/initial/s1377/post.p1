Preconditions:
The input parameter `n` represents the total number of vertices in the graph.
The input parameter `edges` represents the edges of the graph, where each element in the array is a pair of vertices that are connected by an edge.
The input parameter `t` represents the number of seconds.
The input parameter `target` represents the vertex where the frog needs to be at the end of `t` seconds.

Postconditions:
The method returns a double value representing the probability that the frog is on the vertex `target` after `t` seconds.
The returned probability value is accurate within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer.
