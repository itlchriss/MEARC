You are given an integer `n`. There are `n` rooms numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `meetings` where <code>meetings[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that a meeting will be held during the **half-closed** time interval <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code>. All the values of <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> are **unique**. 3. When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original **start** time should be given the room.
