Preconditions:
- `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in ascending order.
- `nums1` and `nums2` are not null.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `k` is less than or equal to the total number of possible products (`nums1.length * nums2.length`).

Postconditions:
- The method returns the `k`th smallest product of `nums1[i] * nums2[j]`, where `i` is between 0 and `nums1.length - 1`, and `j` is between 0 and `nums2.length - 1`.
- The returned product is a long data type.
