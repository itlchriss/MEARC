The Java method `kthSmallestProduct` takes in two sorted 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, as well as a long integer `k`. It calculates the kth (1-based) smallest product of `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`, where `i` ranges from 0 to the length of `nums1` and `j` ranges from 0 to the length of `nums2`. The method returns this calculated product.
