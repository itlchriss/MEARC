The arrays `nums1` and `nums2` must be sorted in ascending order, with a 0-indexed format, as input for the method.The integer `k` used as input must be based on 1.The kth smallest product of `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` must be the output.The bounds of `nums1` and `nums2` must contain the indices `i` and `j`, respectively, for the method to work correctly.The smallest product among all possible products must be the product of `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`, where `nums1` and `nums2` are arrays sorted in ascending order.The calculation of the product for every possible combination of `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` is required.In addition, the calculation of the product is required for each combination of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`, ensuring that it strictly follows the syntax of the provided examples and avoids any dangling modifier.Furthermore, it is necessary to compute the product for each pair of elements that meet the conditions `0 <= i < nums1.length` and `0 <= j < nums2.length`, where `nums1` and `nums2` refer to the parameter arrays.
