The condition is satisfied if the value of nums[1] is changed to 1 and the value of nums[2] is changed to 1, resulting in the program fulfilling the requirement.In order for the array nums to become [1, 1, 1], it is necessary for the program to successfully modify the values of nums[1] and nums[2]. For each element in nums, the program should calculate the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j], where i and j represent distinct indices.The program should return the minimum possible score, which is determined by the parameter array being sorted in ascending order.The condition is that the value of at most two elements in the nums array can be changed.The array of integers, nums, is sorted in ascending order.The condition is satisfied if the value of nums[1] is changed to 1 and the value of nums[2] is changed to 1, resulting in a non-null outcome.In order for the array nums to become [1, 1, 1], it is necessary for the program to successfully modify the values of nums[1] and nums[2]. For each element in the nums array, the program should calculate the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j], where i and j represent distinct indices.The program should return the minimum possible score as the result, given that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The condition for the program is that the value of at most two elements in the array nums can be changed.
