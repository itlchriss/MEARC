You are given some events `[start, end)`, after each given event, return an integer `k` representing the maximum `k`\-booking between all the previous events. myCalendarThree.book(10, 20); // return 1, The first event can be booked and is disjoint, so the maximum k-booking is a 1-booking. myCalendarThree.book(50, 60); // return 1, The second event can be booked and is disjoint, so the maximum k-booking is a 1-booking. myCalendarThree.book(10, 40); // return 2, The third event [10, 40) intersects the first event, and the maximum k-booking is a 2-booking. myCalendarThree.book(5, 15); // return 3, The remaining events cause the maximum K-booking to be only a 3-booking. myCalendarThree.book(5, 10); // return 3 myCalendarThree.book(25, 55); // return 3
initial prepare.sh run.sh `int book(int start, int end)` Returns an integer `k` representing the largest integer such that there exists a `k`\-booking in the calendar.
