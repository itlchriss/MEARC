Preconditions:
The method should take four parameters: an integer n, a 2D integer array edges, an integer array values, and an integer k.
The value of n should be a positive integer.
The length of the edges array should be greater than or equal to The length of the values array should be equal to n.
The value of k should be a positive integer.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the maximum number of components in any valid split.
The returned value should be greater than or equal to The returned value should be less than or equal to n.
The method should handle cases where there are no valid splits and return The method should handle cases where there is only one component and return The method should handle cases where all components are divisible by k and return the total number of components.
The method should handle cases where no component is divisible by k and return The method should handle cases where some components are divisible by k and return the maximum number of components that can be split while maintaining the divisibility condition.
