The `prepare . sh` script must be executed before the main functionality, ensuring that the system has it.The execution of the main functionality is performed by the system using a script called `run.sh`, which is responsible for running the system.The function `next(int n)` exhausts the next `n` elements from the parameter array and returns the last element exhausted, ensuring that all elements are exhausted.If there are no more elements to exhaust, the function should return `-1`.To obtain the last element exhausted by exhausting 2 terms of the sequence, the system should have a method `rLEIterator.next(2)`.The sequence of elements [8, 5, 5] should be the remaining sequence after executing the `next(2)` method with the parameter `2` on the `RLEIterator` object.To obtain the last element exhausted and exhaust one term of the sequence, the array parameter should be sorted in ascending order.The sequence of elements [5, 5] should be the remaining sequence after executing the `next(1)` method with a parameter of 1.To obtain the last element exhausted and exhaust one term of the sequence, the array parameter should be sorted in ascending order.After the execution of `rLEIterator.next(1)`, the sequence that remains should only contain the element [5].To obtain the last exhausted element and exhaust 2 terms of the sequence, the system should have a method `next(2)` that returns -1. This is because the first exhausted term is 5, but the second term, which does not exist, cannot be exhausted.The system should return -1 since the last exhausted term does not exist.
