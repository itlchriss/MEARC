The initial running of the `prepare.sh` script is required for the system.After executing the `prepare.sh` script, the `run.sh` script should be run in order for the system to function properly.The function `int add(int val)` should be present in the system, where the integer `val` is appended to the stream.The function `kthLargest.add(int val)` should be included in the system. This function appends the integer `val` to the stream and returns the element that represents the kth largest element in the stream. The system should have a public constructor `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` that takes in the parameters `k` and `nums`.When `add()` is called, the system should return the kth largest element in the stream, where the kth largest element is determined by the parameter `k` and the stream is represented by the parameter `nums`.When the method `public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` is called with the parameter `k` representing the desired size and the parameter `nums` representing the array of numbers, the system should return the result as follows: When the method `public int add(int val)` is called with the parameter `val` representing the value to be added, the system should return the result as follows: When `kthLargest.add(3)` is called, the system should return When `kthLargest.add(5)` is called, the system should return When `kthLargest.add(10)` is called, the system should return When `kthLargest.add(9)` is called, the system should return When `kthLargest.add(4)` is called, the system should return 8.
