The method should return an integer value representing the number of tuples `(i, j, k, l)` that satisfy the given condition.
The method should handle the case when no tuples `(i, j, k, l)` satisfy the given condition and return The method should handle the case when all tuples `(i, j, k, l)` satisfy the given condition and return the total number of tuples.
The method should handle the case when there are duplicate tuples `(i, j, k, l)` and count them as separate tuples.
The method should not modify the input arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, and `nums4`.
