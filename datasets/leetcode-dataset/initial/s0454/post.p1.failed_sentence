The four integers `(i ,  j ,  k ,  l)` form the tuples.The indices of the elements in the arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, and `nums4` are the integers in the tuples.The arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, and `nums4` all have a length of `n`.The count of all possible combinations of indices `(i, j, k, l)` is the number of tuples returned.The integers in the tuples can be repeated in the arrays nums1, nums2, nums3, and nums4.The integers from different arrays can be used in the tuples.The index of the tuples from different arrays can be the same.The indices of the tuples from the same array can differ.The indices from the same array can be the same for the tuples.The indices of the tuples can vary across different arrays.The indices from different arrays can be the same for the tuples.The indices of the tuples from the same array can differ.The indices from the same array can be the same for the tuples.The total number of valid combinations of indices `(i ,  j ,  k ,  l)` that satisfy the given conditions is equal to the count of tuples returned.The final result of the function is the count of tuples returned.
