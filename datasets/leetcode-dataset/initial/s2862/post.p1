The maximum element-sum of a complete subset of the indices set `{1 ,  2 ,   .  .  .  ,  n}` should be calculable by the system.The output should be the maximum sum of the elements in the parameter list.The indices set `{1 ,  2 ,   .  .  .  ,  n}` should be considered by the system as all possible subsets.The condition for the system to consider subsets is that they must include all elements from the indices set `{1 ,  2 ,   .  .  .  ,  n}`.The element-sum of each complete subset should be calculated by the system.The maximum element-sum among all complete subsets should be determined by the system, given that the parameter list of integers is provided.The maximum element-sum should be returned as the result by the system.
