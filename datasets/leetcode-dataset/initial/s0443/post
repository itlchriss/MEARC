The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`. After you are done **modifying the input array**, return _the new length of the array_.
**Output:** Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"] **Output:** Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"] **Output:** Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"]. **Output:** Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","3","b","2","a","2"].
