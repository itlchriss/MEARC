The method should take four parameters: n (an integer denoting the number of horizontal bars in the grid), m (an integer denoting the number of vertical bars in the grid), hBars (an array of integers representing the positions of the horizontal bars), and vBars (an array of integers representing the positions of the vertical bars).
The values of n and m should be non-negative integers.
The length of the hBars array should be less than or equal to n.
The length of the vBars array should be less than or equal to m.
The values in the hBars array should be non-negative integers less than n.
The values in the vBars array should be non-negative integers less than m.
