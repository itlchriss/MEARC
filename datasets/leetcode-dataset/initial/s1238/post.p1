Preconditions:
- The input integer `n` must be greater than or equal to - The input integer `start` must be between 0 and 2^n - 1 (inclusive).

Postconditions:
- The returned list `p` must be a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 2^n - - The length of the returned list `p` must be 2^n.
- The first element of the returned list `p` must be the input integer `start`.
- The elements in the returned list `p` must be in a circular permutation, meaning that if we consider the list as a circular array, the next element after the last element should be the first element.
