The returned list `p` must be a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 2^n - - The length of the returned list `p` must be 2^n.
The first element of the returned list `p` must be the input integer `start`.
The elements in the returned list `p` must be in a circular permutation, meaning that if we consider the list as a circular array, the next element after the last element should be the first element.
