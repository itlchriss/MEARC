The size of the list `p` must be equivalent to `2^n` in order to adhere to the requirements of the circular permutation method, where `n` represents the number of elements and `start` denotes the starting point.The integers ranging from 0 to `2^n - 1` should be the elements of the permutation `p` in the method public List<Integer> circularPermutation(int n, int start).The permutation `p` must meet the requirement of being a valid permutation, which implies that it must include all the integers from 0 to `2^n - 1` in a precise order, exactly once.The permutation `p` can have any valid permutation of the elements, where the elements are ordered in ascending order.Based on the given integers `n` and `start`, the generation of the permutation `p` is required.The output of the task should be the permutation `p`, which is returned.
