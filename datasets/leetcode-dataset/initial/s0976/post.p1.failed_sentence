The input for the system is an integer array `nums`, and the system calculates the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area.The `nums` array is utilized by the system to create a triangle using three lengths. Afterward, the possibility of forming a triangle with a non-zero area is verified.If it is impossible to sort the parameter array in ascending order, the system returns `0`. Otherwise, the system returns the largest perimeter of the formed triangle if it is possible to form a triangle with a non-zero area.
