The input `n` should be an integer, and the calculation of the number of square triples should be possible for the system.To determine the count of square triples, the consideration of all potential combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` is necessary. These combinations should satisfy the condition `1 <= a, b, c <= n`.The verification of each combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` forming a square triple should also be performed by the system.After examining all possible combinations, the count of square triples that have been discovered should be determined by the system.The count of square triples returned by the system should be the output.
