The script named "str_prepare.sh" needs to be run initially for the system to have the result of not being null, the parameter array to be sorted in ascending order, and the methods public void append(int val), public void addAll(int inc), public void multAll(int m), and public int getIndex(int idx) to be applied.After running "prepare.sh", the system should execute a script called "str_run.sh" in order to strictly adhere to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."The function named str_getIndex should be present in the system, which takes an index as input.The value at the given index of the sequence should be returned by the function str_getIndex.The index of the sequence should start from 0.The calculation of the sequence should be performed modulo 10^9 + If the provided index is greater than or equal to the length of the sequence, the function str_getIndex ought to return - The existence of an object named "fancy" is required for the system.The method named "getIndex" should be present in the object str_fancy, adhering to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."The current value at the given index of the sequence should be returned by the method str_getIndex.The index 10 should be returned when the index parameter is called with an index of 2.
