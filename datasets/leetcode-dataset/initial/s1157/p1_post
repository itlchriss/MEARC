The method `query` should return an integer value.
If there exists an element in the subarray `arr[left...right]` that occurs at least `threshold` times, the method `query` should return that element.
If there is no element in the subarray `arr[left...right]` that occurs at least `threshold` times, the method `query` should return -1.
