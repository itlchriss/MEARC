The output is a string representing the count of each atom in the chemical formula.
The output string is in the form of the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than `1`), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than `1`), and so on.
The output string does not contain any atoms that have a count of `0`.
The output string is sorted in alphabetical order based on the atom names.
