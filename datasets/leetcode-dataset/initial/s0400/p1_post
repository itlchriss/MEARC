The method should return an integer representing the `n`th digit of the infinite integer sequence.
The returned digit should be between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
If `n` is less than or equal to 9, the method should return `n`.
If `n` is greater than 9, the method should return the `n`th digit of the sequence `[10, 11, 12, ...]`.
