The input for the system should be an integer `n`, and the system should have the capability to handle positive values of `n`.The `n`th digit of the infinite integer sequence should be returned by the system, with zero being considered a valid input for `n`.The method should be capable of handling negative values of `n` and should also be able to handle large values of `n`.Furthermore, the ability of the system to handle decimal values of `n`, as well as non-numeric and non-integer values of `n`, should be ensured.The handling of null_value or empty input for `n` and out-of-range values of `n`, such as `n` being greater than the length of the sequence, is required.Furthermore, the input for `n` should be able to handle special characters or symbols, as well as leading zeros.Moreover, the input for `n` should be able to handle leading and trailing spaces, while the output should be able to handle different data types such as integers and strings.Furthermore, the array of parameters should be arranged in ascending order, while also being capable of accommodating special characters or symbols, as well as leading zeros.Furthermore, the handling of leading and trailing spaces in the output, as well as the management of errors or exceptions that may arise during execution, should be ensured.The provision of appropriate error messages or feedback for invalid inputs or errors is expected by the system, ultimately.
