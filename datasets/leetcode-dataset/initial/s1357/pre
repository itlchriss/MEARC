The supermarket decided to have a sale. Every <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> customer paying for their groceries will be given a **percentage discount**. The discount amount is given by `discount`, where they will be given `discount` percent off their subtotal. More formally, if their subtotal is `bill`, then they would actually pay `bill initial prepare.sh run.sh ((100 - discount) / 100)`.
