1605\. Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums
You are given two arrays `rowSum` and `colSum` of non-negative integers where `rowSum[i]` is the sum of the elements in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> row and `colSum[j]` is the sum of the elements of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.
