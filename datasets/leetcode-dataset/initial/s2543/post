Given two integers `targetX` and `targetY` representing the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of your final position, return `true` _if you can reach the point from_ `(1, 1)` _using some number of steps, and_ `false` _otherwise_. **Explanation:** It is impossible to reach (6,9) from (1,1) using any sequence of moves, so false is returned.
