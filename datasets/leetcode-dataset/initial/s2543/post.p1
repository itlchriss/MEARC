Given two integers `targetX` and `targetY`, representing the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of your final position, the Java method `isReachable(int x, int y)` returns `true` if it is possible to reach the point `(targetX, targetY)` from the starting point `(1, 1)` using some number of steps. If it is not possible to reach the point, the method returns `false`. This is determined by checking if there exists any sequence of moves that can lead from `(1, 1)` to `(targetX, targetY)`. In the case of `(6, 9)` as the target point, it is not possible to reach it from `(1, 1)` using any sequence of moves, resulting in the method returning `false`.
