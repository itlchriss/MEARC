Preconditions:
- The input integer `n` must be a positive integer.
- The input integer `n` must fit in a 32-bit integer.

Postconditions:
- The method should return the smallest integer that has exactly the same digits as `n` and is greater in value than `n`.
- If no such positive integer exists, the method should return -- If the smallest integer that satisfies the conditions does not fit in a 32-bit integer, the method should return -1.
