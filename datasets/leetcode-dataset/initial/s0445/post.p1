The method addTwoNumbers takes two non-empty linked lists, l1 and l2, as parameters. These linked lists represent two non-negative integers, with the most significant digit at the head of each list. Each node in the linked lists represents a single digit. The method adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. The result data type of the method is ListNode. The algorithm assumes that the linked lists are non-empty and that the sum is represented as a linked list.
