The minimum cost required to travel from the starting point (startX, startY) to the target point (targetX, targetY) should be calculated by the system. The most efficient path or route should be determined by the system.The cost of each step or movement from one point to another should be considered by the system, taking into account any obstacles or barriers that may affect the cost of travel, when the parameter array specialRoads is sorted in ascending order.The most efficient path or route from the starting point to the target point, considering the cost of each step or movement, should be determined by the system, given the parameter arrays start, target, and specialRoads.Taking into account any obstacles or barriers that may affect the cost of travel, the cost of each step or movement should be considered by the system.The final minimum cost required to reach the target point, calculated based on the cost of each step or movement, should be provided to the user by the system.The starting and target points should have different coordinate values, allowing flexibility in input for the method.The starting and target points should include both positive and negative coordinate values, allowing for a wide range of input.The starting and target points should allow for precise calculations by the system, with the coordinate values being decimal or fractional.The start array should contain the initial values for each step or movement, while the target array should contain the desired values for each step or movement. The specialRoads array should contain the customized cost values for each specific requirement, allowing for different cost values to be handled by the system.The start array, target array, and specialRoads array should be used by the system to handle various types of cost calculations. These calculations include distance, time, and resources required. The purpose is to offer flexibility in determining the minimum cost.The start array should be sorted in ascending order to ensure compatibility with various measurement systems for the cost calculations.Considering weather conditions or traffic congestion, the cost of travel should be calculated by the system, taking into account different scenarios or situations that may affect it.The start array must be sorted in ascending order, while the target array is not null. The specialRoads array must offer precise and dependable outcomes, guaranteeing the accuracy of the calculations and keeping the cost at a minimum to achieve the target point.The start array should not be null, and the target array should be sorted in ascending order. The specialRoads array should handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the calculation process, effectively addressing and resolving them.The start array must not be null.The calculation of the minimum cost to different target points from the same starting point should be handled by the system, while also accommodating multiple calculations simultaneously, given the parameter arrays start, target, and specialRoads.The minimum cost from different starting points to the same target point should be calculated by the system, while also allowing for diverse calculations, by handling multiple requests and using the parameter arrays start, target, and specialRoads, which should be sorted in ascending order.The method should efficiently process multiple calculations, ensuring efficient processing of multiple calculations, by handling concurrent or simultaneous requests for calculating the minimum cost from different starting and target points, using the parameter arrays start, target, and specialRoads.The start and target arrays should be provided in ascending order, and the specialRoads array should not be null. The system should be able to handle large or complex coordinate values and calculations without significant performance issues, while maintaining optimal performance regardless of the complexity of the input.The minimum cost should be adjusted by the system during the travel process if any relevant factors change, allowing for real-time updates or changes to the cost calculations. The relevant factors are represented by the parameter array, which is sorted in ascending order.
