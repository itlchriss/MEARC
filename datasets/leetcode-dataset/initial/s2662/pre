You are given an array `start` where `start = [startX, startY]` represents your initial position `(startX, startY)` in a 2D space. You are also given the array `target` where `target = [targetX, targetY]` represents your target position `(targetX, targetY)`. There are also some special roads. You are given a 2D array `specialRoads` where <code>specialRoads[i] = [x1<sub>i</sub>, y1<sub>i</sub>, x2<sub>i</sub>, y2<sub>i</sub>, cost<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> special road can take you from <code>(x1<sub>i</sub>, y1<sub>i</sub>)</code> to <code>(x2<sub>i</sub>, y2<sub>i</sub>)</code> with a cost equal to <code>cost<sub>i</sub></code>. You can use each special road any number of times.
