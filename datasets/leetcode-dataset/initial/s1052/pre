There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for `n` minutes. Every minute, some number of customers enter the store. You are given an integer array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of the customer that enters the store at the start of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute. On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where `grumpy[i]` is `1` if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> minute, and is `0` otherwise.
