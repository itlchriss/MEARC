Preconditions:
- The input strings `s` and `t` are not null.
- The input strings `s` and `t` have the same length.
- The input integer `maxCost` is non-negative.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.
- If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`, the method returns 0.
