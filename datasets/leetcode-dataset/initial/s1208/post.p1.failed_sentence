The maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to match the corresponding substring of `t` should be calculated by the system, given that the cost of changing each character is limited to `maxCost`.The cost of changing each character in the substring of `s` to its corresponding character in the substring of `t` should be considered by the system.The cost of changing each character should be compared by the system to the maximum cost specified as `maxCost`.The maximum length of the substring that can be changed within the specified cost limit should be returned by the system.If the cost limit is exceeded, the system should return `0` if there is no substring from the string `s` that can be transformed to its corresponding substring from the string `t`.
