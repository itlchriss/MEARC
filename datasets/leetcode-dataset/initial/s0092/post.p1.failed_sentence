To reverse a portion of a singly linked list, we need the `head` of the list and two integers `left` and `right`, where `left` is the starting position and `right` is the ending position. The condition `left <= right` must be satisfied. The algorithm will reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right` and return the resulting reversed list.
