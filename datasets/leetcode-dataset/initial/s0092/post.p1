The head of a singly linked list should be taken as input by the function.The input for the function should consist of two integers, `left` and `right`, which will be used as parameters.The value of `left` must be less than or equal to the value of `right` in the method `reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right)` which reverses a sublist of nodes in the `head` list.The nodes of the linked list should be reversed by the function from the position `left` to the position `right`, ensuring that the function strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples and uses no pronouns.The reversed list should be returned by the function.If the head of the linked list is null, the function should return an empty list.If the range of nodes to be reversed in the linked list starts and ends at the same node, the function should return the linked list as is.If the values of `left` and `right` are equal, the list should remain unchanged and be returned as is.If the values of `left` and `right` are not within the valid range (less than 1 or greater than the length of the list), the list should remain unchanged.The original linked list should be modified by the function and a new one should not be created.The nodes within the specified range should be reversed within the given linked list.The order of the nodes outside the range of `left` to `right` should be maintained by the function.The nodes between `left` and `right` inclusive should be reversed by the function.The `next` pointers of the nodes should be updated by the function in order to reverse the list.The `next` pointer of the node at position `left-1` should be updated by the function to point to the node at position `right`.The `next` pointer of the node at position `right` should be updated by the function to point to the node at position `right+1`.The `next` pointer of the node at position `left` should be updated to point to the node at position `right+1` after reversing the list, ensuring that the method `reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right)` is used.The `next` pointer of the node at position `right` should be updated to point to the node at position `left-1` after reversing the list, ensuring that the method `reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right)` is used.The scenario in which `left` represents the first node in the list should be accounted for by the function.The condition should be handled by the function in cases where the value of `right` corresponds to the final node in the list.
