Preconditions:
- The method should take in two arrays, "capacity" and "rocks", and an integer "additionalRocks".
- The "capacity" array should contain the initial capacity of each bag.
- The "rocks" array should contain the number of rocks already present in each bag.
- The "additionalRocks" integer should represent the number of additional rocks that need to be placed in the bags.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an integer representing the maximum number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags.
- The bags should be filled in a way that maximizes the number of bags with full capacity.
- The bags should not exceed their initial capacity after placing the additional rocks.
