The Bitset constructor initializes a Bitset object with a specified size. The fix method fixes the bit at the given index. The unfix method unfixes the bit at the given index. The flip method flips all the bits in the Bitset object. The all method returns true if all the bits are set to true. The one method returns true if only one bit is set to true. The count method returns the number of bits set to true. The toString method returns a string representation of the Bitset object.
