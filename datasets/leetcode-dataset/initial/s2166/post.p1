public void flip()
   - Preconditions: 
     - The Bitset object is not null.
   - Postconditions: 
     - All the bits in the Bitset are flipped (0s become 1s and 1s become 0s).

public boolean all()
   - Preconditions: 
     - The Bitset object is not null.

   - Preconditions: 
     - The Bitset object is not null.
   - Postconditions: 
     - Returns a string representation of the Bitset, where each character in the string represents the value of the corresponding bit in the Bitset.
