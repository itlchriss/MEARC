The `all()` method should return `false` if not all values of the bitset are set to 1. 
The `one()` method should return `true` if there is at least one index with value 1 in the bitset.The total number of bits in the bitset that have value should be returned by the method `count()`. The current composition of the bitset should be represented as a string by the method `toString()`, where each character in the string corresponds to the value at the corresponding bit in the bitset.
