Preconditions:
- The method takes in three parameters: `nums1`, `nums2`, and `x`.
- `nums1` is a list of integers.
- `nums2` is a list of integers.
- `x` is an integer.
- The sum of all elements in `nums1` is initially 
Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the minimum time required to make the sum of all elements in `nums1` less than or equal to `x`.
- If it is not possible to make the sum of all elements in `nums1` less than or equal to `x`, the method returns -1.
