Preconditions:
The value of `k` must be a positive integer.
The value of `n` must be a positive integer.
The value of `k` must be greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
The method should return a long value representing the sum of the `n` smallest k-mirror numbers.
The returned sum should be a non-negative value.
If there are less than `n` k-mirror numbers, the method should return the sum of all available k-mirror numbers.
The method should handle large values of `k` and `n` efficiently without causing any overflow or memory issues.
