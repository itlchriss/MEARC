The output should be an array named str_answer.The size of the str_answer array must match the size of the "queries" array.The str_answer array should have each of its elements representing a boolean value.The true_value in the str_answer array should correspond to the existence of a path between the values of "a_i" and "b_i" for each query, indicating that the result is not null. Additionally, the parameter array should be sorted in ascending order to ensure the correct functionality of the method.In contrast, if there is no path between the values of "a_i" and "b_i" for the i-th query, the false_value should be the corresponding element in the str_answer array, given that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order and the result is not null.
