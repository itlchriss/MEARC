The method `areConnected` returns an array `answer` of type `List<Boolean>`.
The length of `answer` is equal to the length of `queries`.
Each element in `answer` is either `true` or `false`.
If there is a path between `a_i` and `b_i` for the `i-th` query, then `answer[i]` is `true`.
If there is no path between `a_i` and `b_i` for the `i-th` query, then `answer[i]` is `false`.
Preconditions:
The constructor `DisjointSetUnion` requires one input parameter `n`.
The value of `n` must be a positive integer.
