Preconditions:
- The method `areConnected` requires three input parameters: `n`, `threshold`, and `queries`.
- The value of `n` must be a positive integer.
- The value of `threshold` must be a positive integer.
- The value of `queries` must be a two-dimensional array of integers.
- The length of `queries` must be equal to the length of the array `answer`.
- Each element in `queries` must be a pair of integers representing two nodes in a graph.

Postconditions:
- The method `areConnected` returns an array `answer` of type `List<Boolean>`.
- The length of `answer` is equal to the length of `queries`.
- Each element in `answer` is either `true` or `false`.
- If there is a path between `a_i` and `b_i` for the `i-th` query, then `answer[i]` is `true`.
- If there is no path between `a_i` and `b_i` for the `i-th` query, then `answer[i]` is `false`.

Preconditions:
- The constructor `DisjointSetUnion` requires one input parameter `n`.
- The value of `n` must be a positive integer.

Postconditions:
- The constructor `DisjointSetUnion` creates an instance of the `DisjointSetUnion` class.
- The instance has a property `n` which is set to the value of the input parameter `n`.

Preconditions:
- The method `find` requires one input parameter `u`.
- The value of `u` must be a valid node in the graph.

Postconditions:
- The method `find` returns an integer representing the root of the set that `u` belongs to.

Preconditions:
- The method `union` requires two input parameters `u` and `v`.
- The values of `u` and `v` must be valid nodes in the graph.

Postconditions:
- The method `union` merges the sets that `u` and `v` belong to into a single set.
