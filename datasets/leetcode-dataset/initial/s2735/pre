You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n` representing the cost of collecting different chocolates. The cost of collecting the chocolate at the index `i` is `nums[i]`. Each chocolate is of a different type, and initially, the chocolate at the index `i` is of <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> type. Return _the minimum cost to collect chocolates of all types, given that you can perform as many operations as you would like._
