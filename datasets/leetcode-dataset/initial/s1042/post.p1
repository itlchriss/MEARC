Preconditions:
- The input parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of gardens.
- The input parameter `paths` is a 2D array representing the paths between gardens.
- The number of rows in `paths` is equal to the number of paths between gardens.
- Each row in `paths` contains two integers representing the indices of the gardens connected by the path.
- The indices of the gardens in `paths` are valid and within the range of 1 to `n`.
- The gardens are connected in a non-cyclic manner, i.e., there are no loops in the paths.
- The input `n` and `paths` satisfy the condition that it is possible to plant flowers in such a way that no two adjacent gardens have the same type of flower.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an array `answer` of length `n`.
- Each element in `answer` represents the type of flower planted in the corresponding garden.
- The flower types in `answer` are denoted by the integers 1, 2, 3, or - The flower types in `answer` satisfy the condition that no two adjacent gardens have the same type of flower.
- The returned `answer` array is a valid solution, i.e., it is possible to plant flowers in such a way that satisfies the given conditions.
