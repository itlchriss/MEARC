The input parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of gardens.
The input parameter `paths` is a 2D array representing the paths between gardens.
The number of rows in `paths` is equal to the number of paths between gardens.
Each row in `paths` contains two integers representing the indices of the gardens connected by the path.
The indices of the gardens in `paths` are valid and within the range of 1 to `n`.
The gardens are connected in a non-cyclic manner, i.e., there are no loops in the paths.
The input `n` and `paths` satisfy the condition that it is possible to plant flowers in such a way that no two adjacent gardens have the same type of flower.
