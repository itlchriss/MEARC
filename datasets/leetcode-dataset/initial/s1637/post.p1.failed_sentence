The widest vertical area between two points on a 2D plane is calculated by the system.The input should consist of `n` points, where each point's x and y coordinates represent it.The widest vertical area should be ensured by the system, where no points are inside it.The width of the widest vertical area should be determined by the system.The widest vertical area, which is defined by two points, should be identified by the system.The output should be the widest vertical area, which is determined by the system.
