The input strings `s1` and `s2` of size `n` should be taken by the system.The input string `evil` should be taken as an input by the system.The number of good strings should be calculated by the system.The condition to be checked by the system is that the size of the string that is considered good should be equal to `n`.The condition to be checked is that the good string should be alphabetically greater than or equal to `s1`, and this should be done by the system.The condition to be checked by the system is that the string `s1` should be alphabetically smaller than or equal to the string `s2`.The condition to be checked by the system is that the good string, which is a parameter of the method, should not contain the string 'evil' as a substring.The number of good strings modulo `10^9 + 7` should be returned by the system.
