The method findGoodStrings(int n, String s1, String s2, String evil) should return the count of valid strings. A valid string is a string of size n that is greater than or equal to s1 alphabetically, smaller than or equal to s2 alphabetically, and does not contain the substring "evil". The count should be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
