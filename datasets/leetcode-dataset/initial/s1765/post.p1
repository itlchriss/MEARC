Preconditions:
The input matrix `isWater` must not be null.
The input matrix `isWater` must have at least one row and one column.
The input matrix `isWater` must contain only integers.

Postconditions:
The output matrix `height` must be of size `m x n`, where `m` is the number of rows in `isWater` and `n` is the number of columns in `isWater`.
The output matrix `height` must contain only integers.
The value of `height[i][j]` must represent the height of cell `(i, j)` in the input matrix `isWater`.
If there are multiple solutions, the output matrix `height` can be any valid solution.
