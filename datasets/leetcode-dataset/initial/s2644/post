Return _the integer_ `divisors[i]` _with the maximum divisibility score_. If there is more than one integer with the maximum score, return the minimum of them. Since divisors[2] has the maximum divisibility score, we return it. Since divisors[0], divisors[1], and divisors[2] all have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[2]). Since divisors[0] and divisors[1] both have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[0]).
