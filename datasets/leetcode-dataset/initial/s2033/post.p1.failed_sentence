The grid should be accurately transformed into a uni-value by the minimum number of operations, with the value of x being used as a parameter.The output should be the minimum number of operations, ensuring that it is the correct result, when the grid parameter is passed as a two-dimensional array and the x parameter is passed as an integer.If the grid cannot be made uni-value, the system should return -1, indicating the impossibility.The grid parameter should contain multiple occurrences of the same requirement, with the x parameter consistently returning the same result each time.The grid, which is the parameter array, should be sorted in ascending order in order for the system to handle multiple requests for calculating the minimum number of operations to make it uni-value. The system should respond promptly to each request.The grid sizes, regardless of their dimensions, should be handled by the system.The grid passed as the parameter should be able to handle different values in each cell, ensuring that the variations are accommodated.The grid passed as the parameter should be handled by the system, considering the presence of the same value in each cell as a special case.The grid passed as the parameter should contain a combination of different values and the same value in each cell, considering both scenarios.Taking into account the negative numbers, the system should handle grids with negative values.The grid passed as the parameter should be able to handle zero values, with the ability to recognize and process these zeros.The grid should contain positive values, and the positive numbers should be treated accordingly by the system.The grid passed as the parameter should contain a combination of positive and negative values, and the system should accurately handle this combination.The grid passed as the parameter should contain floating-point values, specifically decimal numbers, and the system should be able to handle it.The grid, which is capable of processing and manipulating large values effectively, should be handled by the system.The grid passed as a parameter should have small values, guaranteeing accuracy even when dealing with small numbers.The grid, consisting of a combination of large and small values, should be accommodated by the system, allowing for the range of values.Taking into consideration the absence of data, the absence of values or empty cells in the grid should be handled by the system.The grid passed as the parameter should be handled by the system, recognizing and interpreting correctly the special characters or symbols as values, in order to ensure that the result is not null.The grid passed as a parameter to the method should contain alphanumeric values, allowing for a combination of letters and numbers, and the system should be able to handle it.The grid passed as a parameter to the method should be handled by the system, taking into account and appropriately handling non-numeric values.The grid passed as a parameter should be handled by the system, accurately managing the mix of numeric and non-numeric values.The scenario of having duplicate entries in the parameter grid should be considered valid, and the system should handle it accordingly.The grid passed as the parameter should contain unique values, and the method should correctly recognize and process these unique entries.The grid, consisting of a combination of duplicate and unique values, should be accurately handled by the system, ensuring that the mix of duplicates and unique entries is handled correctly.The grid's dimensions (rows and columns) should be handled by the system, regardless of their size, when the parameter array is passed to the method with the integer x.The grid, which has an equal number of rows and columns, should be handled by the system, treating square grids as a special case.The method should be able to handle grids that have a different number of rows and columns, allowing for rectangular grids.The grid with irregular shapes (e.g., triangular, hexagonal) should be accurately processed, ensuring that the system handles them properly.The method should effectively manage both types of grid shapes, handling grids with a combination of regular and irregular shapes, and ensuring that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.Accurately processing the mix of regular and irregular shapes with varying sizes, the system should handle grids with a combination of regular and irregular shapes and different dimensions, where the parameter grid represents the grid itself and the parameter x represents the specified value.Accurately managing the mix of regular and irregular shapes in square grids, the system should handle grids with a combination of regular and irregular shapes. The grids should have an equal number of rows and columns, ensuring that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The method should effectively process rectangular grids with a combination of regular and irregular shapes, where the number of rows and columns can vary.The grid passed as the parameter should be able to handle a combination of regular and irregular shapes, as well as missing values or empty cells. The absence of data should be accounted for in both regular and irregular grid shapes.Accurately interpreting and processing the mix of special characters or symbols in both regular and irregular grid shapes, the combination of regular and irregular shapes and special characters or symbols as values should be handled by the system, with the system being able to handle grids with a combination of regular and irregular shapes and special characters or symbols as values.The grid should be able to handle a combination of regular and irregular shapes and alphanumeric values, effectively managing the mix of alphanumeric entries in both regular and irregular grid shapes, when the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.Accurately processing the mix of non-numeric entries in both regular and irregular grid shapes, the system should handle grids with a combination of regular and irregular shapes and non-numeric values, where the parameter grid represents the grid structure and the parameter x represents a certain value.The grid should contain a combination of regular and irregular shapes and a combination of numeric and non-numeric values, effectively managing the mix of numeric and non-numeric entries in both regular and irregular grid shapes, when the parameter x is used.Accurately processing the mix of duplicate entries in both regular and irregular grid shapes, the system should handle grids with a combination of regular and irregular shapes and duplicate values, where the parameter grid is an array sorted in ascending order and the parameter x is not null.The grid parameter should contain a combination of regular and irregular shapes and unique values, with the system recognizing and processing the mix of unique entries in both regular and irregular grid shapes.Accurately managing the mix of duplicate and unique entries in both regular and irregular grid shapes, the combination of regular and irregular shapes and the combination of duplicate and unique values should be handled by the system, while strictly adhering to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."
