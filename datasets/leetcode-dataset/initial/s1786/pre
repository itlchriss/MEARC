There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight equal to <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>.
