- The `edges` array is not null.
- The `edges` array has a length greater than or equal to - The `edges` array contains only positive integers.
- The `edges` array contains valid edges between nodes.
- The `n` parameter is greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the number of restricted paths from node 1 to node `n`.
- The returned value is modulo `10^9 + 7`.
