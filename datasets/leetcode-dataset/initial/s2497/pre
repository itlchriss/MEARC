Given an integer `k`, return _the **maximum star sum** of a star graph containing **at most**_ `k` _edges._
There is an undirected graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `vals` of length `n` where `vals[i]` denotes the value of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i.</sub></code> A **star graph** is a subgraph of the given graph having a center node containing `0` or more neighbors. In other words, it is a subset of edges of the given graph such that there exists a common node for all edges.
