The strings "left" and "right" represent two positive integers. These integers should be considered as positive integers when checking for palindromes, squares, and counting the number of super-palindromes.The integer returned by the method should represent the number of super-palindrome integers within the inclusive range of integers specified by the parameters "left" and "right".The inclusive left and right integers should be considered as part of the range. This range can be any positive integers with leading zeros represented as strings.A super-palindrome is defined as an integer that is a palindrome and its square is also a palindrome.The integer returned should represent the number of super-palindromes, and it can be any positive integer with leading zeros represented as a string.The integers provided as input may contain leading zeros, but they should always be considered as positive integers.The integers provided as input, despite their varying lengths, must be considered as positive integers.During the examination of palindromes and squares, it is necessary to regard the input integers as positive integers, even if they have leading zeros.When examining palindromes and squares, it is necessary to treat the input integers as strings, even if they contain leading zeros.The integers provided as input, regardless of any leading zeros, must be considered as positive integers when counting the number of super-palindromes.During the count of super-palindromes, the count must regard the input integers as strings, even if they have leading zeros.The range of integers can have a large range, a small range, a range with the same number, a range with consecutive numbers, or a range with non-consecutive numbers.The positive integers that can be represented as strings can be any range of integers.The integers that can be represented as strings are any positive integers with leading zeros, and these integers can be any range of integers.The examination of palindromes and squares must regard positive integers with leading zeros as positive integers, which are encompassed within the range of integers.The range of integers with leading zeros, which should be considered as positive integers when counting the number of super-palindromes, can be any positive integers.The examination of palindromes, squares, and the counting of super-palindromes must regard the range of integers encompassing positive integers with leading zeros as positive integers.
