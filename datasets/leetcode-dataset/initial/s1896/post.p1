Preconditions:
The method should take two integer parameters, val and minFlips.
The val parameter represents the initial value of the expression.
The minFlips parameter represents the minimum number of flips allowed to change the final value of the expression.
The expression parameter should be a valid string representing a logical expression.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the minimum cost to change the final value of the expression.
The minimum cost refers to the minimum number of operations required to change the final value.
The final value of the expression should be changed according to the minimum number of flips allowed.
The method should handle cases where the initial value of the expression is already the desired final value, in which case the minimum cost would be 0.
