The index within the range `[0, w.length - 1]` is randomly selected by the function `pickIndex()`, which strictly adheres to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."The probability of selecting an index `i` is determined by the formula `w[i] / sum(w)`, where `w` is the parameter array sorted in ascending order.The selected index is the result when the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.In the scenario where the array `w` contains only one element, the outcome will always be the index with the highest probability. However, if the array `w` consists of multiple elements, the result will still be the index with the highest probability.The index is appropriately returned based on the probabilities when the function handles multiple consecutive calls to `pickIndex()` and the probabilities are related to the parameters.The selection of an index is determined by the value of `w[i]` in relation to the sum of all elements in `w`, ensuring that the probability is proportional.The scenario is handled by the function when the sum of all elements in the parameter array `w` is 0, resulting in an appropriate outcome.The scenario is handled by the function when the elements in the parameter array, denoted as `w`, are negative numbers, resulting in an appropriate outcome.The scenario is handled by the function when the elements in the parameter array, `w`, are non-integer numbers, and it appropriately returns a result.
