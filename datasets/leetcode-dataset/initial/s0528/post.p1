Preconditions:
- The input array `w` must not be null.
- The input array `w` must have at least one element.

Postconditions:
- The method `pickIndex()` returns an integer value within the range `[0, w.length - 1]`.
- The probability of picking an index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.
- If there is only one element in `w`, the method always returns - If there are multiple elements in `w`, the method returns an index with a probability proportional to its corresponding weight in `w`.
- The method can be called multiple times, and the returned index may vary based on the probability distribution defined by `w`.
- The method returns the same index multiple times if its corresponding weight in `w` is higher than the other indices.
- The method returns different indices if their corresponding weights in `w` are equal.
