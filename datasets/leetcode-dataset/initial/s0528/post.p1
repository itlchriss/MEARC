Preconditions:
- The input array `w` must not be null.
- The input array `w` must have at least one element.

Postconditions:
- The method `pickIndex()` returns an integer value representing an index in the range `[0, w.length - 1]`.
- The probability of picking an index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.
- If there is only one element in `w`, the method always returns - If there are multiple elements in `w`, the method returns an index with a probability proportional to the element's value in `w` compared to the sum of all elements in `w`.
