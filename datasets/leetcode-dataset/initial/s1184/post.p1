Preconditions:
The `distance` array must not be null.
The `start` and `destination` values must be valid indices within the `distance` array.
The `start` and `destination` values must be different.

Postconditions:
The method should return an integer value representing the shortest distance between the `start` and `destination` stops.
If the `start` and `destination` stops are the same, the method should return If the `start` stop is located before the `destination` stop in the `distance` array, the method should return the sum of distances between the `start` and `destination` stops.
If the `start` stop is located after the `destination` stop in the `distance` array, the method should return the sum of distances between the `destination` and `start` stops.
