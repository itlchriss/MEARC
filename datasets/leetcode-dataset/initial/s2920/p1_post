The method should return an integer value representing the maximum points that can be obtained after collecting the coins from all tree nodes.
The maximum points should be calculated by removing a maximum of k edges from the tree and collecting the coins from the remaining nodes.
The method should consider all possible combinations of removing edges and collecting coins to find the maximum points.
The method should handle cases where the edges array is empty or null, and return 0 in such cases.
The method should handle cases where the coins array is empty or null, and return 0 in such cases.
The method should handle cases where k is less than 0, and return 0 in such cases.
The method should handle cases where k is greater than the total number of edges in the tree, and return the maximum points that can be obtained by collecting all the coins.
The method should handle cases where the coins array contains negative values, and consider them as zero when calculating the maximum points.
The method should handle cases where the coins array contains values greater than the maximum integer value, and consider them as the maximum integer value when calculating the maximum points.
