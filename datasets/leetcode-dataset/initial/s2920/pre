There exists an undirected tree rooted at node `0` with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D **integer** array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given a **0-indexed** array `coins` of size `n` where `coins[i]` indicates the number of coins in the vertex `i`, and an integer `k`.
