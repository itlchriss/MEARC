The maximum points that can be obtained by collecting coins from all tree nodes should be calculated by the system.When calculating the maximum points, the consideration of all tree nodes by the system is necessary.The coins should be collected from each tree node, with the system being responsible for this task.The maximum number of points that can be obtained by collecting coins from all tree nodes should be determined by the system, given the parameters edges, coins, and k.
