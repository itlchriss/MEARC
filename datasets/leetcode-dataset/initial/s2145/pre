You are given a **0-indexed** array of `n` integers `differences`, which describes the **differences** between each pair of **consecutive** integers of a **hidden** sequence of length `(n + 1)`. More formally, call the hidden sequence `hidden`, then we have that `differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i]`. You are further given two integers `lower` and `upper` that describe the **inclusive** range of values `[lower, upper]` that the hidden sequence can contain. initial prepare.sh run.sh For example, given `differences = [1, -3, 4]`, `lower = 1`, `upper = 6`, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length `4` whose elements are in between `1` and `6` (**inclusive**).
