To execute the `prepare.sh` script, the system initialization requires it to be executed.To ensure the execution of the system, the `run.sh` script must be executed.The function `randPoint()` must be implemented by the system, ensuring that the array parameter is sorted in ascending order and the result is not null.The function `randPoint()` generates a random point within the circle, with the circle's radius, x-coordinate of the center, and y-coordinate of the center provided as parameters.Considering a point on the circumference of the circle as inside the circle is crucial.The array `[x ,  y]` should be returned as the answer format by the `randPoint()` function.The `Solution` class should exist in the system.The constructor of the `Solution` class should accept three parameters: `1 . 0` for the radius, `0 . 0` for the x-coordinate of the center, and `0 . 0` for the y-coordinate of the center.In order to create an instance of the `Solution` class, the constructor should be utilized, with the parameters `double radius`, `double xCenter`, and `double yCenter`.The `randPoint()` function is invoked on the instance of the `Solution` class, ensuring that the result is not null.Upon the initial call of the `randPoint()` function, the resulting value should be `[-0 . 02493 ,  -0 . 38077]`.When the `randPoint()` function is called for the second time, the returned value should be `[0 . 82314 ,  0 . 38945]`.The outcome of the third call to the `randPoint()` function should be `[0 . 36572 ,  0 . 17248]`, ensuring that the parameter values for `radius`, `xCenter`, and `yCenter` are properly considered.
