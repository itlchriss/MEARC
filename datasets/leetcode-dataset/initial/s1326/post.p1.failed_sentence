The minimum number of taps required to water the entire garden should be calculated by the system.In the case where it is not possible to water the entire garden, the system should take into account the availability and functionality of each tap.The method should prioritize taps with a higher water flow rate, just like the system gives priority to taps that have a higher water flow rate.The garden's sufficient water coverage should be ensured by the system, making sure that all areas receive it.The distribution of water should be considered by the system, taking into account any obstacles or barriers that may affect it.The selection of taps should be optimized by the system in order to minimize water wastage.The output of the system should clearly and concisely indicate the minimum number of taps required, with the parameter array being sorted in ascending order.The value of the variable "result" is not equal to null. 
The elements in the array "parameter array" are arranged in ascending order.The system mentioned in the previous sentences is referred to by both the pronoun "it" and the term "the system" in these sentences. The pronoun "str_it" and the term "the system" in these sentences both refer to the same thing, which is the system mentioned earlier.
