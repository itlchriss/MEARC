The input strings, `text1` and `text2`, should be taken by the system.The longest common subsequence between `text1` and `text2` should be found by the system.The length of the longest common subsequence should be returned by the system.If the parameter `text1` and the parameter `text2` have no common subsequence, the system should return 0.
