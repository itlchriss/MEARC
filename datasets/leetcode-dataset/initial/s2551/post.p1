Preconditions:
- The method takes in an array of integers called "weights" and an integer called "k" as parameters.
- The "weights" array contains positive integers representing the weights of marbles.
- The integer "k" represents the number of marbles to be distributed.
- The "weights" array is not null.
- The "k" value is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the length of the "weights" array.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a long value representing the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.
- The maximum score is the sum of the weights of the heaviest "k" marbles in any distribution.
- The minimum score is the sum of the weights of the lightest "k" marbles in any distribution.
- If there is only one possible distribution, where the maximum and minimum scores are the same, the method returns 0.
