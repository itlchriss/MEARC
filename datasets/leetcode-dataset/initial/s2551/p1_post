The method returns a long value representing the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.
The maximum score is the sum of the weights of the heaviest "k" marbles in any distribution.
The minimum score is the sum of the weights of the lightest "k" marbles in any distribution.
If there is only one possible distribution, where the maximum and minimum scores are the same, the method returns 0.
