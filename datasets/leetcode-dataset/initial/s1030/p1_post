The method returns a two-dimensional array of integers.
The returned array contains the coordinates of all cells in the matrix.
The coordinates are sorted by their distance from (rCenter, cCenter) from the smallest distance to the largest distance.
The order of the coordinates in the returned array satisfies the condition of being sorted by distance.
