Preconditions:
- The method takes four integer parameters: rows, cols, rCenter, and cCenter.
- The values of rows and cols are positive integers.
- The values of rCenter and cCenter are within the range of the matrix dimensions.
- The matrix is a two-dimensional array of integers.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a two-dimensional array of integers.
- The returned array contains the coordinates of all cells in the matrix.
- The coordinates are sorted by their distance from (rCenter, cCenter) from the smallest distance to the largest distance.
- The order of the coordinates in the returned array satisfies the condition of being sorted by distance.
