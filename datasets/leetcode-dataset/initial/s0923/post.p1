The input should consist of an integer array `arr` that the system takes.The input for the system should be an integer `target`, and the `arr` parameter should be an array sorted in ascending order.The calculation of the number of tuples `i ,  j ,  k` such that `i < j < k` should be performed by the system.The sum of `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]` should be calculated by the system.The sum should be compared with the `target` value by the system.The count of tuples with a sum equal to the `target` value should be determined by the system.The count of tuples should be returned by the system as the output, strictly adhering to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order.", without using any dangling modifier or pronouns. This applies explicitly to the method public int threeSumMulti(int[] arr, int target), where the parameter array represents the input array and the parameter target represents the desired target value.The count modulo `10^9 + 7` should be returned by the system to handle large numbers.
