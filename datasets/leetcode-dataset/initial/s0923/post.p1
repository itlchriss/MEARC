Preconditions:
- The input array `arr` is not null.
- The input array `arr` contains at least three elements.
- The input integer `target` is not null.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- The returned value is the number of tuples `i, j, k` such that `i < j < k` and `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target`.
- The returned value is modulo `10^9 + 7`.
