Given a **non-negative** integer `num`, return `true` _if_ `num` _can be expressed as the sum of any **non-negative** integer and its reverse, or_ `false` _otherwise._ **Explanation:** 172 + 271 = 443 so we return true. **Explanation:** 63 cannot be expressed as the sum of a non-negative integer and its reverse so we return false. **Explanation:** 140 + 041 = 181 so we return true. Note that when a number is reversed, there may be leading zeros.
