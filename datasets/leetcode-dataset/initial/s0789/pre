You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point `[0, 0]`, and you are given a destination point <code>target = [x<sub>target</sub>, y<sub>target</sub>]</code> that you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as a 2D array `ghosts`, where <code>ghosts[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the starting position of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> ghost. All inputs are **integral coordinates**.
