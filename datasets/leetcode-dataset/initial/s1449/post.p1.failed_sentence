The input for the function consists of an array of integers named `cost` and an integer named `target`.The maximum integer that can be painted under the given rules should be returned by the function, with the cost array representing the cost of painting each digit and the target parameter representing the target cost.The string representation of the highest integer should be returned when the integer array cost is sorted in ascending order and the target value is reached.If the condition does not allow for any integer to be painted, the function should return `str_0`, given the parameters `cost` and `target`.
