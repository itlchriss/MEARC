The `arr` parameter must consist of elements that are strictly increasing.The array `arr` should consist solely of positive integers.The subsequence that the method public int lenLongestFibSubseq(int[] arr) must find should strictly adhere to the condition of being a Fibonacci-like subsequence.The subsequence's length that must be returned is the length of the subsequence formed by the parameter array.If the array parameter does not contain a Fibonacci-like subsequence, the function should return 0.
