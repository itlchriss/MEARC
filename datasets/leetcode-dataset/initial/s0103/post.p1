The TreeNode root is essential for the structure of the binary tree, as it serves as the required root node.The exploration order of the nodes in the binary tree must be ensured to follow a specific pattern, traversing them in a zigzag manner.The order of traversal must guarantee a consistent output by returning the values of the nodes.The starting point for the traversal of the tree must be established from the left side, ensuring a clear starting point.The movement pattern must be maintained while traversing the tree, with each level alternating between moving from left to right and right to left.The exploration of the entire tree must continue until all nodes have been visited, ensuring a comprehensive traversal.The node values should be returned as a list or array, ensuring a structured and organized representation, when the root TreeNode is passed as a parameter.
