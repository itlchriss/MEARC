Preconditions:
The input string `word` is not null.
The input string `word` contains only lowercase letters.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value representing the minimum total distance to type the input string using only two fingers.
The minimum total distance is calculated based on the distance between adjacent letters on a QWERTY keyboard.
The method handles cases where the input string has a length of 1 or 2 separately.
The method handles cases where the input string has a length greater than 2 by considering all possible combinations of finger movements.
The method returns 0 if the input string is empty.
The method returns 0 if the input string has a length of 1, as there is no distance to type a single letter.
The method returns the distance between the two letters if the input string has a length of The method returns the minimum total distance by considering all possible combinations of finger movements for input strings with a length greater than The method handles cases where the input string has repeated letters by considering the distance between the repeated letters as The method handles cases where the input string has adjacent repeated letters by considering the distance between the repeated letters as The method handles cases where the input string has non-adjacent repeated letters by considering the distance between the repeated letters as the minimum distance between them.
The method handles cases where the input string has multiple repeated letters by considering all possible combinations of finger movements for each repeated letter.
The method handles cases where the input string has multiple repeated letters by considering the distance between the repeated letters as the minimum distance between them.
The method handles cases where the input string has multiple repeated letters by considering the distance between the repeated letters as 0 if they are adjacent.
The method handles cases where the input string has multiple repeated letters by considering the distance between the repeated letters as the minimum distance between them if they are non-adjacent.
