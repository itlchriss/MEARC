Preconditions:
The method criticalConnections should take two parameters: an integer n representing the number of nodes in the network, and a List of Lists connections representing the connections between nodes.
The connections List should contain Lists of size 2, where each inner List represents a connection between two nodes.
The connections List should not be null.
The number of nodes n should be greater than 
Postconditions:
The method should return a List of Lists representing the critical connections in the network.
Each inner List in the returned List should contain two integers representing the nodes connected by a critical connection.
The order of the critical connections in the returned List can be arbitrary.
