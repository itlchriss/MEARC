The array can have the operation applied to any index, and the array is the parameter.The index can have the operation applied to it multiple times.The array of integers, nums, is sorted in ascending order, and the operation being performed is a bitwise OR operation with a maximum value of k.The value of `nums[0] | nums[1] |  .  . .` should be determined in a way that strictly adheres to the syntax of the examples provided. Additionally, it should be noted that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The value of the expression `nums[n - 1]` must be determined.The maximum number of times the operation can be applied is `k`, given that the parameter array `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
