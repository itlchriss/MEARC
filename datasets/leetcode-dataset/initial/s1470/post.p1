If the array nums is sorted in ascending order and the integer n is not null, the system will return an array."The reference 'str_it' strictly pertains to the system, ensuring that it adheres to the syntax. The system is not null. The array parameter is arranged in ascending order."The array nums is not null after the method shuffle is executed.The array, when arranged in a specific manner, will be composed of alternating x values and y values.The array, to which the pronoun "str_which" refers, strictly adheres to the syntax of the given examples and is sorted in ascending order.The array nums is not null after the method is executed. The first n elements of the array nums are sorted in ascending order.The x and y values, which will be represented as subscripts, will both be used as parameters.- The array of integers, nums, is not null.
- The integers in the array nums are sorted in ascending order.The array nums is not null after the method is executed. The first n elements of the array nums are sorted in ascending order.The array will contain multiple pairs of x and y values, and the result will not be null. Additionally, the parameter array will be sorted in ascending order.Referring to "the array", the pronoun "str_it" strictly adheres to the syntax and clearly applies to the situation where the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The array nums is not null after the method is executed. The first n elements of the array nums are sorted in ascending order.The count of pairs in the array will be equal to the value of n."The term 'str_the' strictly refers to the count of pairs, ensuring it is not null."
