Preconditions:
The input parameter "trees" is a 2D array of integers representing the coordinates of trees.
The "trees" array is not null.
The "trees" array contains at least one tree.
The coordinates in the "trees" array are valid and within the permissible range.

Postconditions:
The method returns a 2D array of integers representing the coordinates of trees located on the fence perimeter.
The returned array contains only the trees that are exactly located on the fence perimeter.
The order of the trees in the returned array is the same as the order in the input "trees" array.
If no trees are located on the fence perimeter, the method returns an empty 2D array.
