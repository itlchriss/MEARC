Preconditions:
The input list `nums` is not null.
The input list `nums` is not empty.
The values in the input list `nums` are non-negative integers.
The value of `l` is a non-negative integer.
The value of `r` is a non-negative integer.
The value of `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer value.
The returned value is the count of sub-multisets within `nums` where the sum of elements in each subset falls within the inclusive range of `[l, r]`.
The returned value is modulo `10^9 + 7`.
