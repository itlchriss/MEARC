Preconditions:
- The method takes two integer parameters `start` and `goal`.
- The values of `start` and `goal` are non-negative integers.
- The values of `start` and `goal` are within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value representing the minimum number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal`.
- The returned value is non-negative.
- The returned value is the minimum possible number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal`.
