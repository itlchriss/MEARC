Given two integers `start` and `goal` as parameters, the algorithm implemented in the Java method `minBitFlips` determines the minimum number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal`. The result returned by the method is an integer value of 3, indicating that at least 3 bit flips are necessary for the conversion.
