The method findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) requires the person to reconstruct the itinerary in the correct order. The tickets parameter represents a list of airline tickets, where each ticket is represented as [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>], indicating the departure and arrival airports of a flight. The itinerary must start with the airport str_JFK since the person departs from that location. If there are multiple valid itineraries, the person should return the itinerary with the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
