You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> represent the start and the end of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.
