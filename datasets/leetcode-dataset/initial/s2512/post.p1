Preconditions:
- The method should take two integer parameters, `id` and `points`.
- The `id` parameter should represent the ID of the student.
- The `points` parameter should represent the number of points the student has.
- The `id` parameter should be a positive integer.
- The `points` parameter should be a non-negative integer.

Postconditions:
- The method should return an array of integers representing the IDs of the top `k` students.
- The returned array should be in non-increasing order based on the points of the students.
- If more than one student has the same points, the student with the lower ID should rank higher.
- The returned array should contain the IDs of the students who have the highest `k` points.
- The length of the returned array should be less than or equal to `k`.
- If there are fewer than `k` students, the returned array should contain all the student IDs.
- The returned array should be sorted in ascending order.
