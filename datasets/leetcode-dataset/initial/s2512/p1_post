The method should return an array of integers representing the IDs of the top `k` students.
The returned array should be in non-increasing order based on the points of the students.
If more than one student has the same points, the student with the lower ID should rank higher.
The returned array should contain the IDs of the students who have the highest `k` points.
The length of the returned array should be less than or equal to `k`.
If there are fewer than `k` students, the returned array should contain all the student IDs.
The returned array should be sorted in ascending order.
