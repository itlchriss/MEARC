Given an integer `k`, return _the top_ `k` _students after ranking them in **non-increasing** order by their points_. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher. - The student with ID 2 has 1 positive feedback, so he has 3 points. Since student 2 has more points, [2,1] is returned.
