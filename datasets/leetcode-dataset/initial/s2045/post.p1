Preconditions:
The input `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of vertices in the graph.
The input `edges` is a 2D array representing the edges between vertices in the graph.
The input `time` is a positive integer representing the initial time taken to travel from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The input `change` is a positive integer representing the time taken to change the direction of travel at any vertex.

Postconditions:
The method returns an integer representing the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The returned time is greater than or equal to the initial time taken to travel from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The returned time is the second minimum time, meaning there is at least one other path that takes less time to travel from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The returned time takes into account the time taken to change the direction of travel at any vertex.
