The method returns an integer representing the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The returned time is greater than or equal to the initial time taken to travel from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The returned time is the second minimum time, meaning there is at least one other path that takes less time to travel from vertex 1 to vertex n.
The returned time takes into account the time taken to change the direction of travel at any vertex.
