Preconditions:
The method should take two 2D integer arrays as input parameters.
The input arrays should represent interval lists.
The interval lists should be non-empty.

Postconditions:
The method should return a 2D integer array representing the intersection of the two input interval lists.
The returned intersection array should contain intervals that are common to both input lists.
If there is no intersection between the two input lists, the method should return an empty 2D integer array.
