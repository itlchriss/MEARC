The input `n` is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
The input `edges` is a 2D array representing the edges between nodes in the graph.
The input `succProb` is a 1D array representing the success probabilities of traversing each edge.
The length of `edges` is equal to the length of `succProb`.
The input `start` is a valid node in the graph.
