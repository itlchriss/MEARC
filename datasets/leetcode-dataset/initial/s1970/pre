There is a **1-based** binary matrix where `0` represents land and `1` represents water. You are given integers `row` and `col` representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively. Initially on day `0`, the **entire** matrix is **land**. However, each day a new cell becomes flooded with **water**. You are given a **1-based** 2D array `cells`, where <code>cells[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents that on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day, the cell on the <code>r<sub>i</sub><sup>th</sup></code> row and <code>c<sub>i</sub><sup>th</sup></code> column (**1-based** coordinates) will be covered with **water** (i.e., changed to `1`).
