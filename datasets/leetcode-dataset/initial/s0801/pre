You are given two integer arrays of the same length `nums1` and `nums2`. In one operation, you are allowed to swap `nums1[i]` with `nums2[i]`. Return _the minimum number of needed operations to make_ `nums1` _and_ `nums2` _**strictly increasing**_. The test cases are generated so that the given input always makes it possible.
