The task requires the algorithm to search through the array `nums` in order to find the minimum positive non-zero integer that cannot be expressed.The presence of the number 1 in the array `nums` should be checked by the algorithm, which iterates through the elements of the array, in order to strictly adhere to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."Examining each element of the array, the presence of the number 2 should be checked in the array `nums`.The outcome of evaluating whether the number 3 can be obtained from the array `nums` through a bitwise OR operation on two elements of the array must be verified by the algorithm.Examining the outcome of the operation, the algorithm should check if the number 4 can be expressed from the array `nums` through a bitwise OR operation on two elements of the array, ensuring that the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The minimum positive non-zero integer that cannot be expressed from the array `nums` should be provided as the output by the algorithm.
