Given a positive integer `n`, find and return _the **longest distance** between any two **adjacent**_ `1`_'s in the binary representation of_ `n`_. If there are no two adjacent_ `1`_'s, return_ `0`_._ **Explanation:** 8 in binary is "1000". There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
