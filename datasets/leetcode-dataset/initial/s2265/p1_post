The method returns the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree.
If there are no nodes in the subtree of a node, the average value is considered to be The method handles both positive and negative integer values in the tree.
The method handles decimal values in the tree.
The method handles cases where the average value is a fraction or a decimal.
The method handles cases where the average value is an integer.
The method handles cases where the average value is a negative number.
The method handles cases where the average value is zero.
The method handles cases where the average value is the same for multiple nodes in the subtree.
The method handles cases where the average value is different for each node in the subtree.
The method handles cases where the subtree of a node is empty.
The method handles cases where the subtree of a node has only one node.
The method handles cases where the subtree of a node has multiple nodes.
The method handles cases where the binary tree has only one node (the root).
The method handles cases where the binary tree has multiple nodes.
