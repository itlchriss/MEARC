The method should return an integer value representing the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the BST.
The returned minimum difference should be calculated based on the values of the nodes in the BST.
The method should handle the case when the BST is empty and return an appropriate value (e.g., 0 or -1).
The method should handle the case when the BST has only one node and return an appropriate value (e.g., 0 or -1).
The method should handle the case when the BST has multiple nodes and calculate the minimum difference correctly.
The method should handle the case when the BST has duplicate values and calculate the minimum difference correctly.
The method should handle the case when the BST has negative values and calculate the minimum difference correctly.
The method should handle the case when the BST has large values and calculate the minimum difference correctly.
The method should not modify the structure or values of the original BST.
The method should not create any additional data structures or objects, except for temporary variables used for calculations.
