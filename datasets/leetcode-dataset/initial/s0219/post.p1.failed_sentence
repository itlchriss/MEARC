The integer array `nums` and the integer `k` are the input parameters for this method.The term "integer array `nums`" refers to the parameter array, which is sorted in ascending order. The term "integer `k`" refers to the parameter `k`, which is not null.The boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicates whether there exists a nearby duplicate within the parameter array `nums` at a maximum distance of `k`.The boolean value referred to by str_A is not null.The array `nums` is checked by the function to determine if there are two different indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]`, with the condition that the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`.The indices `i` and `j` are referred to by the pronouns str_two and "distinct". Additionally, the function checks if the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k".If the parameter array is sorted in ascending order and the result is not null, then the result is `true`. If the parameter array is not sorted in ascending order or the result is null, then the result is `false`.The conditions for the method include the absence of null results, and the requirement for the parameter array to be sorted in ascending order. The function itself should be able to determine if there are any nearby duplicates within a specified range.
