Postconditions:
The method returns `true` if there exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array `nums` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.
The method returns `false` if there are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array `nums` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.
