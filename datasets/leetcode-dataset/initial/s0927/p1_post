If it is possible to divide the array `arr` into three equal parts, return an array `[i, j]` where `i` is the index of the first element of the second part and `j` is the index of the first element of the third part.
If it is not possible to divide the array `arr` into three equal parts, return the array `[-1, -1]`.
