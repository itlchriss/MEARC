TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL. string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url. string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after deconding it.
initial prepare.sh run.sh `String encode(String longUrl)` Returns a tiny URL for the given `longUrl`. initial prepare.sh run.sh `String decode(String shortUrl)` Returns the original long URL for the given `shortUrl`. It is guaranteed that the given `shortUrl` was encoded by the same object.
