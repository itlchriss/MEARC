The capability to accept a long URL as input should be present in the system.The capability to create a brief URL for the provided lengthy URL should also be present.Furthermore, the capability to store the mapping between the long URL and the short URL should be present.The ability to decode a short URL and retrieve the original long URL must be present, in addition to the requirement that the result is not null.To guarantee consistency, it is necessary to utilize the identical object for encoding and decoding a URL, ensuring that the parameter for encoding a long URL and the parameter for decoding a short URL are the same.To guarantee the authenticity of the short URL, it is necessary for the same object to verify its encoding.When the parameter array is encoded multiple times with the same long URL, the method should return the same short URL.When encoding different long URLs, the generation of different short URLs should occur.Consistently returning the same long URL in a similar manner is expected when decoding the same short URL multiple times.When decoding different short URLs, the result should be different long URLs.In cases where an invalid short URL is given for decoding, an error message should be returned or the error should be gracefully handled.If an invalid long URL is provided for encoding, the method should either return an error message or gracefully handle the error in the same way.
