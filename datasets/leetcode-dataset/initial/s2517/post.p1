The method returns an integer value representing the maximum tastiness of a candy basket.
The returned maximum tastiness value is based on the given price array and the value of k.
The maximum tastiness value is calculated by selecting k candies from the price array in such a way that the sum of their prices is maximized.
If k is greater than the length of the price array, the method returns the sum of all prices in the array as the maximum tastiness value.
If k is equal to the length of the price array, the method returns the sum of all prices in the array as the maximum tastiness value.
If k is less than or equal to zero, the method returns 0 as the maximum tastiness value.
