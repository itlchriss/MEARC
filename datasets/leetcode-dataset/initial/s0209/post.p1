The array of positive integers `nums` and the positive integer `target` are the input.The integer output represents the minimal length of a contiguous subarray. This subarray's sum is greater than or equal to the `target` value. The `target` value is an integer parameter. The `nums` parameter is an array that is used to determine the length of the subarray.If the sum of no subarray in the parameter array `nums` is greater than or equal to the value of the parameter `target`, then the output of the method is `0`.The returned result is the subarray with the minimal length that satisfies the sum condition, given that the subarray is contiguous and the elements are adjacent to each other in the original array, provided that the parameter array nums is sorted in ascending order and the target parameter is not null.The array `nums` must be sorted in ascending order, and it can contain any number of elements. However, the sum of these elements must be greater than or equal to the value of the parameter `target`.The number of elements contained in the subarray is referred to as the length.The array `nums` that is passed as an input to the method `minSubArrayLen` may contain duplicate elements, it may be empty, or it may have only one element. If the array `nums` has multiple elements, but all of them are less than the `target` value, then there is no subarray that satisfies the given condition. Similarly, if the sum of all elements in the array `nums` is less than the `target` value, then there is no subarray that satisfies the given condition.
