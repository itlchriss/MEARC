The array should be snapped by the system using the function `snap()` and the `snap_id` should be returned.The `snap_id` must be equal to the total number of times the `snap()` function has been called minus the number of times the `set()` function has been called. The system should have a function `get(index, snap_id)` that retrieves the value at the specified `index` when the snapshot with the corresponding `snap_id` was taken.The value of the array at the specified `index` with the specified `snap_id` should be returned by the `get()` function.The function `snapshotArr . snap()` should be present in the system, and it should have the capability to capture a snapshot and provide the corresponding `snap_id`.The `snap()` function should return a snapshot with `snap_id = 0` for the `snapshotArr` array.The value of `array[0]` with `snap_id = 0` should be returned by the function `snapshotArr.get(0, 0)` in the system.The function `get(0, 0)` of the `snapshotArr` should return the value `5`.
