The input for the function should consist of an integer array named `nums`, along with two integers named `k` and `t`.The boolean value `true` should be returned by the function if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array `nums`, such that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is less than or equal to `t`, and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k`.In contrast, if there is no pair of distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array `nums` that satisfies the conditions `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t` and `abs(i - j) <= k`, the function should return a boolean value `false`.The array should be considered by the function, taking into account all possible combinations of indices `i` and `j`, within which the indices `i` and `j` strictly adhere to the conditions of the parameters `nums`, `k`, and `t`.The calculation of the absolute difference between the values at indices `i` and `j` in the array should be performed by subtracting one value from the other and taking the absolute value. This calculation should be done in order to determine if there exists a nearby almost duplicate within a certain range `k` and a certain threshold `t` in the given integer array `nums`.The calculation of the absolute difference between the indices `i` and `j` should be performed by subtracting one index from the other and taking the absolute value. This calculation should be done in order to determine if there exists an almost duplicate element within a given range `k` and a maximum difference `t` in the parameter array `nums` that is sorted in ascending order.The absolute difference between the values at indices `i` and `j` must not be greater than `t` for the function to check.The function should additionally verify that the absolute difference between the indices `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k` when considering the parameter array, which is sorted in ascending order, and the parameter `t`.The expected behavior is for the function to return `true` if there exists a pair of distinct indices `i` and `j` in the parameter array `nums` such that the absolute difference between the values at indices `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `t`, and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k`.If the absolute difference between values or the absolute difference between indices is not met for any pair of distinct indices `i` and `j`, the function should return `false`.
