Preconditions:
- The input array `nums` is not null.
- The lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen` are positive integers.
- The lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen` are less than or equal to the length of the input array `nums`.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer representing the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays with lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen`.
