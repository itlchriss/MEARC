Preconditions:
- The input string `s` is not null.
- The input string `s` is not empty.
- The input integer `k` is greater than or equal to 
Postconditions:
- The method returns a string.
- The returned string is the longest subsequence repeated `k` times in the input string `s`.
- If there are multiple longest subsequences repeated `k` times, the returned string is the lexicographically largest one.
- If there is no subsequence repeated `k` times in the input string `s`, the method returns an empty string.
