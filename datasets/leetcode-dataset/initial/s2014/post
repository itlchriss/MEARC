Return _the **longest subsequence repeated**_ `k` _times in string_ `s`_. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the **lexicographically largest** one. If there is no such subsequence, return an **empty** string_. **Explanation:** There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.
