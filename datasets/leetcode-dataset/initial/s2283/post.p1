Return `true` if, for each index `i` in the range `0 <= i < n`, the digit `i` occurs `num[i]` times in the string `num`. Otherwise, return `false`. 

In the case where the condition holds true for every index in the string `str_1210`, the result will be `true`. 

If the condition holds true for every index in the string "1210", the result will also be `true`. 

However, if the condition is violated by the indices 0 and 1, the result will be `false`.
