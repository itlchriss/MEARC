The boolean value `true` is the result if, for each index `i` within the range `0 <= i < n`, the digit `i` appears `num[i]` times in the string `num`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.If for any index `i` in the range `0 <= i < n`, the digit `i` does not occur `num[i]` times in the string `num`, then the result is `false`. Otherwise, the result is `true`.If the condition holds the true_value for every index in the given number, then the result is `true`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.The true_value does not hold for any index in the given number, resulting in `false`. Otherwise, the result is `true`.The outcome is `true` if the count of each digit in the provided number matches its corresponding index; the outcome is `false` otherwise.The boolean value `false` is returned by the method if the count of any digit in the given number does not match its corresponding index in the parameter array. Otherwise, the boolean value `true` is returned.The outcome will be `true` if the count of each digit in the provided number matches its index position; otherwise, the outcome will be `false`.The outcome will be `false` if the count of any digit occurrences in the provided number does not correspond to its index position. In contrast, the outcome will be `true`.
