You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where <code>boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxes<sub>i</sub>, numberOfUnitsPerBox<sub>i</sub>]</code>: You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of **boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.
