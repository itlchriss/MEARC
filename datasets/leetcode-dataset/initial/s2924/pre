You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges` of length `m` representing the **DAG**, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a directed edge from team <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to team <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the graph.
