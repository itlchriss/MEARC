If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with **minimum size** and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the **maximum total sum** of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be **unique**. Also return the answer sorted in **non-increasing** order. **Explanation:** The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to returned in non-decreasing order.
