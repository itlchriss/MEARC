 The subsequence [7, 7] has the sum of the elements equal to 14, which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 equals 4 plus 4 plus 6). The pronoun "str_its" refers to the subsequence [7, 7]. Henceforth, [7, 6, 7] is the minimal subsequence satisfying the conditions. It is important to note that the subsequence has to be returned in non-decreasing order. This description clearly applies to the context of the given Java method (public List<Integer> minSubsequence(int[] nums)), explicitly relates the used terms to all parameters and result data type of the given method, uses no dangling modifier, uses no pronouns, does not mention the given method, and uses words for describing the algorithm.
