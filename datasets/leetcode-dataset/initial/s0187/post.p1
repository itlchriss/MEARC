Preconditions:
The input string `s` should not be null.
The input string `s` should contain only valid DNA characters (A, C, G, T).

Postconditions:
The method should return a list of strings containing all the 10-letter-long sequences that occur more than once in the DNA molecule.
The order of the sequences in the returned list can be arbitrary.
If no 10-letter-long sequences occur more than once in the DNA molecule, the method should return an empty list.
