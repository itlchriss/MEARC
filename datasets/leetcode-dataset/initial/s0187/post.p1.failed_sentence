Acceptance of a string input representing a DNA sequence is required by the system.The DNA sequence should be searched by the system to identify all sequences (substrings) that are 10 letters long.The method should maintain a record of the frequency of every sequence that is 10 letters long.The method should detect the sequences that are 10 letters long and occur more than once in the parameter string.The identified sequences that occur more than once should be stored and returned by the system.The sequences that are identified should be returned by the system in any order.
