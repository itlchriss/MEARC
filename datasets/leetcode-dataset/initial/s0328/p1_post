The reordered linked list should have the same number of nodes as the original linked list.
The nodes with odd indices should be grouped together at the beginning of the reordered list.
The nodes with even indices should be grouped together after the nodes with odd indices in the reordered list.
The relative order of nodes within the odd indices group and even indices group should remain the same as in the original list.
The reordered list should be returned as the output.
