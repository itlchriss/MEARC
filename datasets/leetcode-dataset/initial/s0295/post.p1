To ensure the initial execution of the system, a script named "str_prepare.sh" must be present.After executing the str_prepare.sh script, the system should contain a script named "run.sh" that requires execution.The function named str_findMedian() should be present in the system. This function is responsible for returning the median of all elements.The returned value of the function str_findMedian() should not be null.The system should contain an object named "str_medianFinder" that has a method called "findMedian()".The value 1 should be returned by the initial call of the method "str_findMedian()" for the object "medianFinder", and upon the second call of the method "findMedian()" for the object "medianFinder", the value 2 should be returned.To ensure the initial execution of the system, a script named "str_prepare.sh" must be present.After executing the str_prepare.sh script, the system should contain a script named "run.sh" that requires execution.The function named str_findMedian() should be present in the system. This function is responsible for returning the median of all elements.The median, with a tolerance of 10^-5 in comparison to the actual answer, should be returned by the function str_findMedian().The system should contain an object named "str_medianFinder" that has a method called "findMedian()".The value 1 should be returned by the initial call of the method "str_findMedian()" for the object "medianFinder". When the method "findMedian()" is called for the object "medianFinder" a second time, it should return the value 2.0.
