Preconditions and postconditions for the given Java methods can be extracted as follows:

public MedianFinder():
   - Precondition: None
   - Postcondition: Initializes an empty MedianFinder object.

public void addNum(int num):
   - Precondition: The MedianFinder object must be initialized.
   - Postcondition: Adds the given number 'num' to the MedianFinder object.

public void balance(PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap, PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap):
   - Precondition: The MedianFinder object must be initialized.
   - Postcondition: Balances the two heaps (maxHeap and minHeap) to maintain the median property.

public double findMedian():
   - Precondition: The MedianFinder object must be initialized and have at least one element.
   - Postcondition: Returns the median of all elements added so far. The returned value should be within 10^-5 of the actual answer.
