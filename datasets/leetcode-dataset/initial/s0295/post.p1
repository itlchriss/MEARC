The initial run of the prepare.sh script executes the double findMedian() function, which calculates the median of all elements up to that point. The script accepts answers that are within 10^-5 of the actual answer. 

After that, the findMedian() function is called, which returns the value 1.5. This value represents the average of the numbers 1 and 2. 

Following that, the findMedian() function is called again, and the result is 2.0.
