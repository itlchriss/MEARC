You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where <code>entrance = [entrance<sub>row</sub>, entrance<sub>col</sub>]</code> denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.
