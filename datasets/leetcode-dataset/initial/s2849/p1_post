If the time `t` is less than 0, the method should return `false`.
If the starting coordinates (`sx`, `sy`) are equal to the final coordinates (`fx`, `fy`), the method should return `true` if `t` is 0, and `false` otherwise.
If the absolute difference between `sx` and `fx` is greater than `t`, the method should return `false`.
If the absolute difference between `sy` and `fy` is greater than `t`, the method should return `false`.
If the sum of the absolute differences between `sx` and `fx`, and `sy` and `fy` is equal to `t`, the method should return `true`.
If none of the above conditions are met, the method should return `false`.
