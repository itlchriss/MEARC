Preconditions:
The method should take in five integer parameters: `sx` (starting x-coordinate), `sy` (starting y-coordinate), `fx` (final x-coordinate), `fy` (final y-coordinate), and `t` (time in seconds).
The values of `sx`, `sy`, `fx`, `fy`, and `t` should be non-negative integers.
The method should return a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

Postconditions:
If the time `t` is less than 0, the method should return `false`.
If the starting coordinates (`sx`, `sy`) are equal to the final coordinates (`fx`, `fy`), the method should return `true` if `t` is 0, and `false` otherwise.
If the absolute difference between `sx` and `fx` is greater than `t`, the method should return `false`.
If the absolute difference between `sy` and `fy` is greater than `t`, the method should return `false`.
If the sum of the absolute differences between `sx` and `fx`, and `sy` and `fy` is equal to `t`, the method should return `true`.
If none of the above conditions are met, the method should return `false`.
