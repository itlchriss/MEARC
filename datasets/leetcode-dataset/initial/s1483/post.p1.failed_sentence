To ensure proper initialization, the system must possess a script named "str_prepare.sh" in order for the public TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent) method to function correctly.Upon executing the script "str_prepare.sh", the system should possess a script named "run.sh" that requires execution.The function str_getKthAncestor, which is a part of the system, should have two integer parameters named "node" and "k". The "node" parameter represents a specific node in a tree, while the "k" parameter represents the number of ancestors to retrieve. The function should strictly adhere to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." It should not have any dangling modifiers or pronouns.The returned value of the function str_getKthAncestor should be an integer, just like the result in the first example.The responsibility of finding and returning the kth ancestor of the given node is held by the function getKthAncestor, which takes the parameters node and k.The method getKthAncestor should return -1 if there is no kth ancestor for the given node. The system should have an object named "treeAncestor" with a method called "getKthAncestor". The method public TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent) initializes the tree with the given number of nodes and their corresponding parent nodes. The method public int getKthAncestor(int node, int k) retrieves the kth ancestor of the specified node.The two integer parameters, "node" and "k", should be accepted by the method "str_treeAncestor.getKthAncestor". The method should strictly adhere to the syntax of the given examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order." The purpose of the method is to find the kth ancestor of a given node.The integer value returned by the public method getKthAncestor, which is a part of the public class TreeAncestor, should be the result of the method.The responsibility of finding and returning the kth ancestor of the given node is held by the method getKthAncestor in the str_treeAncestor class.When the given node does not have a kth ancestor, the method `getKthAncestor` of the `TreeAncestor` class should return -1. For instance, when the parameters (3, 1) are passed to the method, it should return the kth ancestor. Similarly, when the parameters (5, 2) are passed, it should return the kth ancestor. However, when the parameters (6, 3) are passed, it should return -1.
