The input for the system should be an array of strings, and this input should be able to be processed by the system.The array of strings, which is the parameter, should be accurately checked by the system to determine if any of the strings are palindromic.The first palindromic string found in the array should be promptly returned by the system.If the array of strings passed as a parameter does not contain any palindromic strings, the system should consistently return an empty string.The string should be considered palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards; this definition must be strictly adhered to by the system.When an empty input array is encountered, the system should return the empty string to ensure that no exceptions occur.
