Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

=======
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.
