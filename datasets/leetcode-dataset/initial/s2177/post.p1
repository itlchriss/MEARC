The parameter num must be an integer expressed as a complete number without any decimal or fractional parts in order for the result to not be null.The array, which is a collection of elements organized in a specific order, must be the output.The array of output must consist of three consecutive integers, indicating that the integers should be in a sequence without any gaps, similar to how the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.The ascending order must be applied to the output array, indicating that the numbers within the array should be arranged from the smallest to the largest, in order to strictly adhere to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."The sum of the three integers in the output array should be equal to the input integer. This indicates that when the three numbers in the array are added together, their total must be the same as the input number.If the input integer cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, the resulting array must be empty, indicating that it should not contain any elements.
