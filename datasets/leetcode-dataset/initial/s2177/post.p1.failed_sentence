The method `sumOfThree` takes an integer `num` as input and returns an array of three consecutive integers, sorted in ascending order, whose sum is equal to `num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, the method returns an empty array. For example, if the input is `num = 10`, the method should return `[3, 4, 5]`.
