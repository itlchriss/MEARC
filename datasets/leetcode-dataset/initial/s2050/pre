You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `relations` where <code>relations[j] = [prevCourse<sub>j</sub>, nextCourse<sub>j</sub>]</code> denotes that course <code>prevCourse<sub>j</sub></code> has to be completed **before** course <code>nextCourse<sub>j</sub></code> (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a **0-indexed** integer array `time` where `time[i]` denotes how many **months** it takes to complete the <code>(i+1)<sup>th</sup></code> course. The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. **Explanation:** The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. initial prepare.sh run.sh The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
