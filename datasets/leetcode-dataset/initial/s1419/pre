You are given the string `croakOfFrogs`, which represents a combination of the string `"croak"` from different frogs, that is, multiple frogs can croak at the same time, so multiple `"croak"` are mixed. _Return the minimum number of_ different _frogs to finish all the croaks in the given string._ A valid `"croak"` means a frog is printing five letters `'c'`, `'r'`, `'o'`, `'a'`, and `'k'` **sequentially**. The frogs have to print all five letters to finish a croak. If the given string is not a combination of a valid `"croak"` return `-1`. **Explanation:** The given string is an invalid combination of "croak**"** from different frogs.
