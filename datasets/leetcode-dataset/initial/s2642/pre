There is a **directed weighted** graph that consists of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges of the graph are initially represented by the given array `edges` where <code>edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, edgeCost<sub>i</sub>]</code> meaning that there is an edge from <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> with the cost <code>edgeCost<sub>i</sub></code>. initial prepare.sh run.sh `Graph(int n, int[][] edges)` initializes the object with `n` nodes and the given edges.
