The pronoun "str_it" in the sentence "The result is the minimum cost" refers to the function `shortestPath(int node1, int node2)`.
The pronoun "str_it" in the sentence "In case there is no path, the result is -1" refers to the function `shortestPath(int node1, int node2)`.
The pronoun "str_it" in the sentence "when we call `g.shortestPath(3, 2)`, the result is 6" refers to the function `shortestPath(int node1, int node2)`.
The pronoun "str_this" in the sentence "This indicates that the shortest path" refers to the returned value of the function `shortestPath(int node1, int node2)`.
The pronoun "str_this" in the sentence "This path can be followed" refers to the shortest path from node 3 to node 2.
The pronoun "str_it" in the sentence "when we call `g.shortestPath(0, 3)`, the result is -1" refers to the function `shortestPath(int node1, int node2)`.
The function `shortestPath(int node1, int node2)` is referred to by the pronoun "str_it" in the sentence "if we call `g.shortestPath(0, 3)` again, it now returns 6".
The pronoun "str_this" in the sentence "This is because the shortest path" refers to the returned value of the function `shortestPath(int node1, int node2)`.
The pronoun "str_this" in the sentence "This path can be followed" refers to the shortest path from node 0 to node 3. These pronouns clearly apply to the context of the given Java method (public Graph(int n, int[][] edges), public void addEdge(int[] edge), public int shortestPath(int node1, int node2), public Pair(K key, V value), public K getKey(), public V getValue()), and explicitly relate the used terms to all parameters and result data type of the given method. The sentence uses no dangling modifier, no pronouns, and does not mention the given method. It also uses words for describing the algorithm.
