The `prepare . sh` script, which needs to be run prior to executing any other scripts, should be present in the system.The `run . sh` script that can be executed should be present in the system after running `prepare . sh`.The function `shortestPath` should be present in the system and it should accept two integer parameters `node1` and `node2`.The cost of the path from `node1` to `node2` that has the minimum value should be returned by the function `shortestPath`.If there is no path from `node1` to `node2`, the `shortestPath` function should return the sum of the costs of the edges in the path as the cost of the path.In order for the system to find the shortest path, a graph `g` that can be used should be present.The function for finding the shortest path between two nodes in the graph should have the capability to do so.The cost of the shortest path between two nodes, which is the minimum, should be returned by the function `g . shortestPath`.The minimum cost for a given path should be correctly returned by the `g . shortestPath` function.In the event that there is no path connecting two nodes, the `shortestPath` function of the system should produce the following result: The minimum cost for the path from node 3 to node 2 is 6.The system's capability of finding the shortest path from node 0 to node 3 should be ensured. In case there is no path from node 0 to node 3, the system should return -The minimum cost for the shortest path from node 0 to node 3 should be returned as 6.
