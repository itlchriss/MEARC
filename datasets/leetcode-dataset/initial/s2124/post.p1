The checkString method should return the true_value if every 'a' in the input string, s, is followed by a 'b'. If this condition is not met, the method should return the false_value. For example, if the input string is "abab", every 'a' appears before every 'b', so the method should return the true_value. However, if the input string is "baba", not every 'a' appears before every 'b', so the method should return the false_value. Additionally, if there are no 'a's in the string, it is still considered that every 'a' appears before every 'b', resulting in the method returning the true_value.
