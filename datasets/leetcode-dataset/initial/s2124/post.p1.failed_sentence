The condition for the method's parameter, the string 's', is that it must exclusively consist of the characters 'a' and 'b'.The condition for the string is that every occurrence of 'a' should precede every occurrence of 'b', and the system should determine this.The true_value should be returned by the system if every 'a' is positioned before every 'b' in the string, and only in that case.If there exists any instance in the string where 'a' is not positioned before every 'b', the false_value should be yielded by the system.The absence of instances of 'a' in the string should be handled by the system.
