Given a string `s` consisting of **only** the characters `'a'` and `'b'`, return `true` _if **every**_ `'a'` _appears before **every**_ `'b'` _in the string_. Otherwise, return `false`. Hence, every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return true. Hence, not every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return false. **Explanation:** There are no 'a's, hence, every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return true.
