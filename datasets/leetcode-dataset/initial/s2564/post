**Explanation:** For the first query the substring in range `[0,2]` is **"101"** which has a decimal value of **`5`**, and **`5 ^ 0 = 5`**, hence the answer to the first query is `[0,2]`. In the second query, the substring in range `[2,3]` is **"11",** and has a decimal value of **3**, and **3 `^ 1 = 2`**. So, `[2,3]` is returned for the second query. **Explanation:** In this example there is no substring that answers the query, hence `[-1,-1] is returned`.
_Return an array_ `ans` _where_ <code>ans[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code> _is the answer to the_ <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> _query._
