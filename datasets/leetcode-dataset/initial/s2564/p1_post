The output array `ans` is not null.
The length of the output array `ans` is equal to the number of queries.
Each element in the output array `ans` is an array of length - For each query, the substring in the specified range is found.
For each query, the decimal value of the substring is calculated.
For each query, the XOR operation is performed between the decimal value of the substring and the given number.
For each query, the result of the XOR operation is stored in the corresponding element of the output array `ans`.
If there is no substring that answers the query, the value [-1, -1] is returned.
