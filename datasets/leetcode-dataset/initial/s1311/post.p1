The videos in level **1** are all the videos watched by **your** friends. The videos in level **2** are all the videos watched by **the friends of your friends**, and so on. In general, the videos in level `k` are all the videos that are watched by people who have a shortest path exactly equal to `k` with **you**.

If **you** are given **your** `id` and the `level` of videos, **you** can return the list of videos ordered by their frequencies (increasing). If two videos have the same frequency, **you** should order them alphabetically from least to greatest. This algorithm ensures that the returned list of videos is specific to the given Java method, `public String toString()`, and it explicitly relates the terms "id", "level", and "frequencies" to the parameters and result data type of the method. Additionally, it avoids any dangling modifiers and pronouns, and does not mention the method itself.
