The method should return a list of integers representing a valid n-bit gray code sequence.
The length of the returned list should be equal to 2^n.
Each integer in the returned list should be a binary number of length n.
The returned list should contain unique integers.
The returned list should follow the gray code sequence rules, where adjacent integers differ by only one bit.
