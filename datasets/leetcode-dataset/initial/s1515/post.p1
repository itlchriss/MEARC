To solve the problem, implement an algorithm that calculates the minimum sum of the euclidean distances to all customers. The algorithm takes an array `positions` as input, where each element `positions[i]` represents the position of the `ith` customer on the map as `[xi, yi]`. The algorithm returns a double value, which represents the minimum sum of the euclidean distances.
