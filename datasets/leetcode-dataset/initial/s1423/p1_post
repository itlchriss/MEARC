The method returns an integer value representing the maximum score that can be obtained.
The maximum score is calculated based on selecting a subarray of `cardPoints` with a length of `k`.
The selected subarray must be contiguous, meaning the elements are adjacent in the original array.
The maximum score is obtained by summing the values of the elements in the selected subarray.
If there are multiple possible subarrays with the same maximum score, any one of them can be returned.
