The input for the function should consist of three integers, namely `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a` represents the first integer, `b` represents the second integer, and `c` represents the third integer.The output of the function should be a string, and it should not be null.The happy string should be the longest possible string, with the condition that the number of characters 'a' is greater than or equal to the number of characters 'b', and the number of characters 'b' is greater than or equal to the number of characters 'c'.If there exist multiple longest happy strings, any of them can be returned by the function.In the absence of a string that meets the specified conditions, the function should return the empty string `str_`.
