To solve the problem, we need to find the longest possible happy string given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The happy string should be constructed based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If there are multiple longest happy strings, any of them can be returned. However, if there is no such string, the method should return the empty string `str_`.
