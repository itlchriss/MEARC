To find the largest multiple of three that can be formed by concatenating some of the digits in the given array `digits`, the function `largestMultipleOfThree` should be implemented in Java. The function should return a string representation of the largest multiple of three. If there is no valid answer, the function should return an empty string.

It is important to note that the returned answer must not contain any unnecessary leading zeros. Additionally, since the answer may not fit in an integer data type, it should be returned as a string.

The algorithm for finding the largest multiple of three involves manipulating the digits in the array. The function should iterate through the array and select the digits that can form the largest multiple of three. The selected digits should then be concatenated to form the final result.
