Given an array of digits `digits`, return _the largest multiple of **three** that can be formed by concatenating some of the given digits in **any order**_. If there is no answer return an empty string. Since the answer may not fit in an integer data type, return the answer as a string. Note that the returning answer must not contain unnecessary leading zeros.
