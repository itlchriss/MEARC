The size of any subarray that satisfies the specified condition should be returned by the function, using the parameters "nums" and "threshold".If the condition is not met by any subarray, the function should return -The function should consider a subarray with a size of 1.The elements of the subarray should be compared with a given value (7 in this case) by the function, while strictly adhering to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order.", and without using any dangling modifier or pronouns.The subarray size that satisfies the condition should be returned by the function, where the condition is related to the parameter array and the parameter threshold.The size of the subarray that the function should return as a positive integer is determined by the parameter array being sorted in ascending order and the result not being null.The sizes of any subarrays that meet the condition should be handled by the function, and it should return any of these sizes.The condition should be met where the size of the subarray is greater than the size of the original array or equal to it.The condition should be considered by the function when the size of the subarray is larger than the size of the original array.
