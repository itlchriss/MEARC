Preconditions:
- The method takes in an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold` as parameters.
- The array `nums` is not null.
- The array `nums` is not empty.
- The integer `threshold` is not null.

Postconditions:
- The method returns an integer value.
- If there is at least one subarray in `nums` where the sum of its elements is greater than `threshold`, the method returns the size of any such subarray.
- If there is no subarray in `nums` where the sum of its elements is greater than `threshold`, the method returns -1.
