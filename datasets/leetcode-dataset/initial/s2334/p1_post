The returned integer value represents the size of a subarray.
If there is at least one subarray in `nums` where the sum of its elements is greater than `threshold`, the method returns the size of any such subarray.
If there is no subarray in `nums` where the sum of its elements is greater than `threshold`, the method returns -1.
