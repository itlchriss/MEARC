The input for the function should consist of two integers, where these integers will serve as the numerator and denominator of a fraction.The fraction should be returned in string format, indicating that it should be converted into a string representation, when the numerator and denominator parameters are provided.In situations where there can be multiple solutions, any of them should be returned by the function, regardless of which one it is, just like how the result is not null and the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.
