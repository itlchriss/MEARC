The list of strings provided should be iterated by the system, considering all possible pairs.The comparison of each pair of strings to determine their similarity should be performed by the system.The count of pairs that satisfy the similarity condition should be performed by the system.The count of similar pairs should be returned by the system.The array of parameters, named "words", is sorted in ascending order.The noun phrases that replace them can be referred back to using the pronouns str_it and "they" in these sentences.The resolved version of the sentences is as follows: The words array passed as a parameter is expected to be sorted in ascending order. The result returned by the method similarPairs is expected to be not null.The array of parameters, words, is sorted in ascending order.The method should perform an iteration over all possible pairs of strings in the provided list. It should then compare each pair of strings to determine if they are similar. The method should count the number of pairs that satisfy the similarity condition and, in the end, return the count of similar pairs.
