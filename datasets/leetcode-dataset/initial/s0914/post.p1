The algorithm should determine whether it is possible to split the entire deck, represented by the integer array `deck`, into one or more groups of cards. The groups must be chosen from `X` or more groups, where `X` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The method should return `true` if this condition is met, and `false` otherwise.
