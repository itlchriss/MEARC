The Java method `nextLargerNodes(ListNode head)` returns an integer array `answer`, where each element `answer[i]` represents the value of the next greater node of the `i`-th node in the linked list `head` (1-indexed). If the `i`-th node does not have a next greater node, the corresponding `answer[i]` is set to 0.
