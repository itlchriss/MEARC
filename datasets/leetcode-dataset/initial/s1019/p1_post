The method returns an integer array `answer`.
The length of the `answer` array is equal to the number of nodes in the ListNode object `head`.
For each node in the ListNode object `head`, the corresponding element in the `answer` array (`answer[i]`) is the value of the next greater node of the `i`th node.
If the `i`th node does not have a next greater node, the corresponding element in the `answer` array (`answer[i]`) is set to 0.
