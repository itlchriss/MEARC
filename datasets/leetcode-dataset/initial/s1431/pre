There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have. **Explanation:** There is only 1 extra candy. Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.
