The method `minOperationsQueries` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a 2D array representing the edges of the tree), and `queries` (a 2D array representing the queries).
The `edges` array contains pairs of integers representing the nodes connected by an edge in the tree.
The `queries` array contains pairs of integers representing the nodes for which the minimum number of operations needs to be calculated.
The tree is in its initial state before executing any queries.
