The method returns an array `answer` of length `m`, where `m` is the number of queries.
Each element `answer[i]` in the `answer` array represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the tree to its initial state for the `i`th query.
The tree returns to its initial state after executing each query, meaning that any modifications made during a query are undone before the next query is executed.
