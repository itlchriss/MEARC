Preconditions:
The method `minOperationsQueries` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a 2D array representing the edges of the tree), and `queries` (a 2D array representing the queries).
The `edges` array contains pairs of integers representing the nodes connected by an edge in the tree.
The `queries` array contains pairs of integers representing the nodes for which the minimum number of operations needs to be calculated.
The tree is in its initial state before executing any queries.

Postconditions:
The method returns an array `answer` of length `m`, where `m` is the number of queries.
Each element `answer[i]` in the `answer` array represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the tree to its initial state for the `i`th query.
The tree returns to its initial state after executing each query, meaning that any modifications made during a query are undone before the next query is executed.
