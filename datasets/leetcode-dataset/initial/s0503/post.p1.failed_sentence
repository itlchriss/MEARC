The circular integer array `nums` should be taken as input by the system.The `nums` array should have its next greater number determined for each element.Consider the number `x` in the array, where the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array should be regarded as the subsequent greater number of `x`.The method should perform a circular search in order to find the next greater number for each element in the parameter array.For a number in the parameter array that does not have a next greater number, the expected result that the system should return is `-1`.
