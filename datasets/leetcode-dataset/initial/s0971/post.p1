Preconditions:
- The method takes in a TreeNode object representing the root of a binary tree.
- The method takes in an integer array representing the desired pre-order traversal of the tree.
- The tree is not empty.

Postconditions:
- The method returns a List<Integer> object containing the values of all flipped nodes.
- The order of the values in the list can be in any order.
- If it is impossible to flip the nodes in the tree to make the pre-order traversal match the given voyage, the method returns the list [-1].
