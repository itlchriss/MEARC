The list of values that the function is expected to return should strictly adhere to the syntax of the examples "The result is not null." and "The parameter array is sorted in ascending order."The values in the list should match the values of all nodes that have been flipped.The values in the list can be in any order, just like the parameter array is sorted in ascending order.If the pre-order traversal cannot be matched with the given voyage by flipping the nodes in the tree, the function should return the list [-1].
