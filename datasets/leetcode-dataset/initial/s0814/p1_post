The returned tree is the same as the input tree, but with every subtree not containing a `1` removed.
All nodes in the returned tree that do not contain a `1` are removed, along with their respective subtrees.
The structure of the returned tree is preserved, with only the necessary nodes and subtrees removed.
The returned tree may have a different structure than the input tree, but it will still be a valid binary tree.
The returned tree may have a different root node than the input tree, if the original root node does not contain a `1`.
The returned tree may have different child nodes for each parent node, as long as the child nodes contain a `1`.
The returned tree may have different levels of depth compared to the input tree, as long as all nodes containing a `1` are preserved.
